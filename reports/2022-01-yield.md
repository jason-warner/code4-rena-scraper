[](#about-c4)About C4
---------------------

Code4rena (C4) is an open organization consisting of security researchers, auditors, developers, and individuals with domain expertise in smart contracts.

A C4 code contest is an event in which community participants, referred to as Wardens, review, audit, or analyze smart contract logic in exchange for a bounty provided by sponsoring projects.

During the code contest outlined in this document, C4 conducted an analysis of Yield-Convex contest smart contract system written in Solidity. The code contest took place between January 28—January 30 2022.

`ConvexYieldWrapper.sol` is a wrapper contract for staking convex tokens on the user’s behalf, allowing them to earn rewards on their deposit. Users will interact with the `Ladle.sol` contract’s `batch()` function which:

*   Approves Ladle to move the tokens.
*   Transfers the tokens to `ConvexYieldWrapper.sol`.
*   Wraps/stakes these tokens.
*   Updates accounting and produces debt tokens within `Ladle.sol`.

During `wrap()` and `unwrap()` actions, `_checkpoint()` is used to update the rewards for the `from_` and `to_` accounts. However, the [reference](https://github.com/convex-eth/platform/blob/main/contracts/contracts/wrappers/ConvexStakingWrapper.sol#L395-L397) contract implements a `_beforeTokenTransfer()` function which has been removed from Yield Protocol’s custom implementation.

As a result, it is possible to transfer `wCVX` tokens to another account after an initial checkpoint has been made. By manually calling `user_checkpoint()` on the new account, this user is able to update its deposited balance of the new account while the sender’s balance is not updated. This can be repeated to effectively replicate a user’s deposited balance over any number of accounts. To claim yield generated by the protocol, the user must only make sure that the account calling `getReward()` holds the tokens for the duration of the call.

#### [](#proof-of-concept)Proof of Concept

The exploit can be outlined through the following steps:

*   Alice receives 100 `wCVX` tokens from the protocol after wrapping their convex tokens.
*   At that point in time, `_getDepositedBalance()` returns 100 as its result. A checkpoint has also been made on this balance, giving Alice claim to her fair share of the rewards.
*   Alice transfers her tokens to her friend Bob who then manually calls `user_checkpoint()` to update his balance.
*   Now from the perspective of the protocol, both Alice and Bob have 100 `wCVX` tokens as calculated by the `_getDepositedBalance()` function.
*   If either Alice or Bob wants to claim rewards, all they need to do is make sure the 100 `wCVX` tokens are in their account upon calling `getReward()`. Afterwards, the tokens can be transferred out.

#### [](#tools-used)Tools Used

Manual code review. Discussion/confirmation with the Yield Protocol team.

#### [](#recommended-mitigation-steps)Recommended Mitigation Steps

Consider implementing the `_beforeTokenTransfer()` function as shown in the [reference](https://github.com/convex-eth/platform/blob/main/contracts/contracts/wrappers/ConvexStakingWrapper.sol#L395-L397) contract. However, it is important to ensure the wrapper contract and collateral vaults are excluded from the checkpointing so they are not considered in the rewards calculations.

`ConvexYieldWrapper.sol` is a wrapper contract for staking convex tokens on the user’s behalf, allowing them to earn rewards on their deposit. Users will interact with the `Ladle.sol` contract’s `batch()` function which:

*   Approves Ladle to move the tokens.
*   Transfers the tokens to `ConvexYieldWrapper.sol`.
*   Wraps/stakes these tokens.
*   Updates accounting and produces debt tokens within `Ladle.sol`.

`_getDepositedBalance()` takes into consideration the user’s total collateral stored in all of their owned vaults. However, as a vault owner, you are allowed to give the vault to another user, move collateral between vaults and add/remove collateral. Therefore, it is possible to manipulate the result of this function by checkpointing one user’s balance at a given time, transferring ownership to another user and then create a new checkpoint with this user.

As a result, a user is able to generate protocol yield multiple times over on a single collateral amount. This can be abused to effectively extract all protocol yield.

#### [](#proof-of-concept-1)Proof of Concept

Consider the following exploit scenario:

*   Alice owns a vault which has 100 tokens worth of collateral.
*   At that point in time, `_getDepositedBalance()` returns 100 as its result. A checkpoint has also been made on this balance, giving Alice claim to her fair share of the rewards.
*   Alice then calls `Ladle.give()`, transferring the ownership of the vault to Bob and calls `ConvexYieldWrapper.addVault()`.
*   Bob is able to call `user_checkpoint()` and effectively update their checkpointed balance.
*   At this point in time, both Alice and Bob have claim to any yield generated by the protocol, however, there is only one vault instance that holds the underlying collateral.

[https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-yield/blob/main/contracts/ConvexYieldWrapper.sol#L100-L120](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-yield/blob/main/contracts/ConvexYieldWrapper.sol#L100-L120)

    function _getDepositedBalance(address account_) internal view override returns (uint256) {
        if (account_ == address(0) || account_ == collateralVault) {
            return 0;
        }
    
        bytes12[] memory userVault = vaults[account_];
    
        //add up all balances of all vaults registered in the wrapper and owned by the account
        uint256 collateral;
        DataTypes.Balances memory balance;
        uint256 userVaultLength = userVault.length;
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < userVaultLength; i++) {
            if (cauldron.vaults(userVault[i]).owner == account_) {
                balance = cauldron.balances(userVault[i]);
                collateral = collateral + balance.ink;
            }
        }
    
        //add to balance of this token
        return _balanceOf[account_] + collateral;
    }

Manual code review. Discussion/confirmation with the Yield Protocol team.

#### [](#recommended-mitigation-steps-1)Recommended Mitigation Steps

Ensure that any change to a vault will correctly checkpoint the previous and new vault owner. The affected actions include but are not limited to; transferring ownership of a vault to a new account, transferring collateral to another vault and adding/removing collateral to/from a vault.

> Ultimately mitigation will require to `_checkpoint` also when vault operations happen (especially transfer), this may require a rethinking at the Ladle level as the reason why the warden was able to sidestep the checkpoint is because the `Ladle` doesn’t notify the `Wrapper` of any vault transfers

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

_Submitted by WatchPug_

[https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-yield/blob/e946f40239b33812e54fafc700eb2298df1a2579/contracts/ConvexStakingWrapper.sol#L206-L224](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-yield/blob/e946f40239b33812e54fafc700eb2298df1a2579/contracts/ConvexStakingWrapper.sol#L206-L224)

    function _calcRewardIntegral(
        uint256 _index,
        address[2] memory _accounts,
        uint256[2] memory _balances,
        uint256 _supply,
        bool _isClaim
    ) internal {
        RewardType storage reward = rewards[_index];
    
        uint256 rewardIntegral = reward.reward_integral;
        uint256 rewardRemaining = reward.reward_remaining;
    
        //get difference in balance and remaining rewards
        //getReward is unguarded so we use reward_remaining to keep track of how much was actually claimed
        uint256 bal = IERC20(reward.reward_token).balanceOf(address(this));
        if (_supply > 0 && (bal - rewardRemaining) > 0) {
            rewardIntegral = uint128(rewardIntegral) + uint128(((bal - rewardRemaining) * 1e20) / _supply);
            reward.reward_integral = uint128(rewardIntegral);
        }

`reward.reward_integral` is `uint128`, if a early user mint (wrap) just `1` Wei of `convexToken`, and make `_supply == 1`, and then tranferring `5e18` of `reward_token` to the contract.

As a result, `reward.reward_integral` can exceed `type(uint128).max` and overflow, causing the rewards distribution to be disrupted.

##### [](#recommendation)Recommendation

Consider `wrap` a certain amount of initial totalSupply, e.g. `1e8`, and never burn it. And consider using uint256 instead of uint128 for `reward.reward_integral`. Also, consdier lower `1e20` down to `1e12`.
