[](#about-c4)About C4
---------------------

Code4rena (C4) is an open organization consisting of security researchers, auditors, developers, and individuals with domain expertise in smart contracts.

A C4 audit contest is an event in which community participants, referred to as Wardens, review, audit, or analyze smart contract logic in exchange for a bounty provided by sponsoring projects.

During the audit contest outlined in this document, C4 conducted an analysis of the Canto smart contract system written in Solidity. The audit contest took place between November 23—November 28 2022.

Final report assembled by [itsmetechjay](https://twitter.com/itsmetechjay).

[](#summary)Summary
===================

The C4 analysis yielded an aggregated total of 5 unique vulnerabilities. Of these vulnerabilities, 2 received a risk rating in the category of HIGH severity and 3 received a risk rating in the category of MEDIUM severity.

Additionally, C4 analysis included 13 reports detailing issues with a risk rating of LOW severity or non-critical. There were also 26 reports recommending gas optimizations.

All of the issues presented here are linked back to their original finding.

[](#scope)Scope
===============

The code under review can be found within the [C4 Canto contest repository](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-11-canto), and is composed of 6 smart contracts written in the Solidity programming language and includes 264 lines of Solidity code.

[](#severity-criteria)Severity Criteria
=======================================

C4 assesses the severity of disclosed vulnerabilities based on three primary risk categories: high, medium, and low/non-critical.

High-level considerations for vulnerabilities span the following key areas when conducting assessments:

*   Malicious Input Handling
*   Escalation of privileges
*   Arithmetic
*   Gas use

For more information regarding the severity criteria referenced throughout the submission review process, please refer to the documentation provided on [the C4 website](https://code4rena.com), specifically our section on [Severity Categorization](https://docs.code4rena.com/awarding/judging-criteria/severity-categorization).

### [](#impact)Impact

For any given tx, the fees are sent to its recipient (`To`). Anybody can register an address using the Turnstile contract. Thus, a user is able to create a proxy contract with which they execute other smart contracts. That way, the fees are sent to their own contract instead of the actual application they are using. People who use smart contract wallets don’t even have to bother with setting up a proxy structure. They just add their own wallet to the Turnstile contract.

Also, there might be a possibility of someone setting up a proxy for high-usage contracts where the fees are sent back to the caller. So for contract $X$, we create $X'$ which calls $X$ for the caller. Since $X'$ is the recipient of the tx, it gets the gas refund. To incentivize the user to use $X'$ instead of $X$, $X'$ sends a percentage of the refund to the caller. The feasibility both technically and economically depends on the contract that is attacked. But, theoretically, it’s possible.

The incentive to take it for yourself instead of giving it to the app is pretty high. Since this causes a loss of funds for the app I rate it as HIGH.

### [](#proof-of-concept)Proof of Concept

Registering an address is permissionless:

        function register(address _recipient) public onlyUnregistered returns (uint256 tokenId) {
            address smartContract = msg.sender;
    
            if (_recipient == address(0)) revert InvalidRecipient();
    
            tokenId = _tokenIdTracker.current();
            _mint(_recipient, tokenId);
            _tokenIdTracker.increment();
    
            emit Register(smartContract, _recipient, tokenId);
    
            feeRecipient[smartContract] = NftData({
                tokenId: tokenId,
                registered: true
            });
        }

Fees are sent to the recipient of the tx:

    func (h Hooks) PostTxProcessing(ctx sdk.Context, msg core.Message, receipt *ethtypes.Receipt) error {
    	// Check if the csr module has been enabled
    	params := h.k.GetParams(ctx)
    	if !params.EnableCsr {
    		return nil
    	}
    
    	// Check and process turnstile events if applicable
    	h.processEvents(ctx, receipt)
    
    	contract := msg.To()
    	if contract == nil {
    		return nil
    	}
    
            // ...

### [](#recommended-mitigation-steps)Recommended Mitigation Steps

It’s pretty difficult to fix this properly. The ideal solution is to distribute fees according to each contract’s gas usage. That will be a little more complicated to implement. Also, you have to keep an eye on whether it incentivizes developers to make their contracts less efficient. Another solution is to make this feature permissioned so that only select contracts are allowed to participate. For example, you could say that an address has to be triggered $X$ amount of times before it is eligible for gas refunds.

[](#h-02-a-registered-contract-wont-earn-fees-if-_recipient-is-a-fresh-address)[\[H-02\] A registered contract won’t earn fees if `_recipient` is a fresh address](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-11-canto-findings/issues/93)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

_Submitted by [Jeiwan](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-11-canto-findings/issues/93), also found by [ronnyx2017](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-11-canto-findings/issues/91)_

Users might become victims of a false positive: if they use a fresh account as an NFT recipient during contract registration, the transaction won’t revert, but the registered contract will never earn fees for the token holder. And since a contract can be registered only once, there won’t be a way for affected users to re-register contracts and start earning fees. This can affect both bigger and smaller projects that register their contracts with the Turnstile contract: the only condition for the bug to happen is that the recipient address that’s used during registration is a fresh address (i.e. an address that hasn’t been used yet).

### [](#proof-of-concept-1)Proof of Concept

The `register` function allows the calling contract to specify the address that will receive the freshly minted NFT ([Turnstile.sol#L86](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-11-canto/blob/2733fdd1bee73a6871c6243f92a007a0b80e4c61/CIP-001/src/Turnstile.sol#L86)):

    function register(address _recipient) public onlyUnregistered returns (uint256 tokenId) {
        address smartContract = msg.sender;
    
        if (_recipient == address(0)) revert InvalidRecipient();
    
        tokenId = _tokenIdTracker.current();
        _mint(_recipient, tokenId);
        _tokenIdTracker.increment();
    
        emit Register(smartContract, _recipient, tokenId);
    
        feeRecipient[smartContract] = NftData({
            tokenId: tokenId,
            registered: true
        });
    }

A recipient address can be any address besides the zero address. However, on the consensus layer, there’s a stricter requirement ([event\_handler.go#L31-L33](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-11-canto/blob/2733fdd1bee73a6871c6243f92a007a0b80e4c61/Canto/x/csr/keeper/event_handler.go#L31-L33)): a recipient address cannot be a _fresh account_, that is an address that:

*   hasn’t ever received native coins;
*   hasn’t ever sent a transaction;
*   hasn’t ever had contract code.

While, on the application layer, calling the `register` function with a fresh address will succeed, on the consensus layer a contract won’t be registered.

When a `Register` event is processed on the consensus layer, there’s a check that requires that the recipient address is an _existing account_ in the state database ([event\_handler.go#L31-L33](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-11-canto/blob/2733fdd1bee73a6871c6243f92a007a0b80e4c61/Canto/x/csr/keeper/event_handler.go#L31-L33)):

    // Check that the receiver account  exists in the evm store
    if acct := k.evmKeeper.GetAccount(ctx, event.Recipient); acct == nil {
      return sdkerrors.Wrapf(ErrNonexistentAcct, "EventHandler::RegisterEvent account does not exist: %s", event.Recipient)
    }

If the recipient account doesn’t exist, the function will return, but the register transaction won’t revert (errors during the events processing doesn’t result in a revert: [evm\_hooks.go#L123-L132](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-11-canto/blob/2733fdd1bee73a6871c6243f92a007a0b80e4c61/Canto/x/csr/keeper/evm_hooks.go#L123-L132), [evm\_hooks.go#L49](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-11-canto/blob/2733fdd1bee73a6871c6243f92a007a0b80e4c61/Canto/x/csr/keeper/evm_hooks.go#L49)).

The `GetAccount` function above returns `nil` when an address doesn’t exist in the state database. To see this, we need to unwind the `GetAccount` execution:

1.  The `GetAccount` is called on an `evmKeeper` ([event\_handler.go#L31](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-11-canto/blob/2733fdd1bee73a6871c6243f92a007a0b80e4c61/Canto/x/csr/keeper/event_handler.go#L31)):
    
        if acct := k.evmKeeper.GetAccount(ctx, event.Recipient); acct == nil {
          return sdkerrors.Wrapf(ErrNonexistentAcct, "EventHandler::RegisterEvent account does not exist: %s", event.Recipient)
        }
    
2.  `evmKeeper` is set during the CSR Keeper initialization ([keeper.go#L27](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-11-canto/blob/2733fdd1bee73a6871c6243f92a007a0b80e4c61/Canto/x/csr/keeper/keeper.go#L27)):
    
        func NewKeeper(
          cdc codec.BinaryCodec,
          storeKey sdk.StoreKey,
          ps paramtypes.Subspace,
          accountKeeper types.AccountKeeper,
          evmKeeper types.EVMKeeper,
          bankKeeper types.BankKeeper,
          FeeCollectorName string,
        ) Keeper {
          // set KeyTable if it has not already been set
          if !ps.HasKeyTable() {
            ps = ps.WithKeyTable(types.ParamKeyTable())
          }
        
          return Keeper{
            storeKey:         storeKey,
            cdc:              cdc,
            paramstore:       ps,
            accountKeeper:    accountKeeper,
            evmKeeper:        evmKeeper,
            bankKeeper:       bankKeeper,
            FeeCollectorName: FeeCollectorName,
          }
        }
    
3.  The CSR Keeper is initialized during the main app initialization ([app.go#L473-L478](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-11-canto/blob/2733fdd1bee73a6871c6243f92a007a0b80e4c61/Canto/app/app.go#L473-L478)), this is also when the EVM Keeper is initialized ([app.go#L409-L413](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-11-canto/blob/2733fdd1bee73a6871c6243f92a007a0b80e4c61/Canto/app/app.go#L409-L413)):
    
        app.EvmKeeper = evmkeeper.NewKeeper(
          appCodec, keys[evmtypes.StoreKey], tkeys[evmtypes.TransientKey], app.GetSubspace(evmtypes.ModuleName),
          app.AccountKeeper, app.BankKeeper, &stakingKeeper, app.FeeMarketKeeper,
          tracer,
        )
    
4.  The EVM Keeper is implemented and imported from Ethermint ([keeper.go#L67](https://github.com/evmos/ethermint/blob/f7f1e1c18c64c912e7b5d524ae710e542b47e02a/x/evm/keeper/keeper.go#L67));
5.  Here’s the `GetAccount` function ([statedb.go#L25](https://github.com/evmos/ethermint/blob/f7f1e1c18c64c912e7b5d524ae710e542b47e02a/x/evm/keeper/statedb.go#L25)):
    
        func (k *Keeper) GetAccount(ctx sdk.Context, addr common.Address) *statedb.Account {
          acct := k.GetAccountWithoutBalance(ctx, addr)
          if acct == nil {
            return nil
          }
        
          acct.Balance = k.GetBalance(ctx, addr)
          return acct
        }
    
6.  The `GetAccountWithoutBalance` function calls `GetAccount` on `accountKeeper` ([keeper.go#L255-L258](https://github.com/evmos/ethermint/blob/f7f1e1c18c64c912e7b5d524ae710e542b47e02a/x/evm/keeper/keeper.go#L255-L258)):
    
        acct := k.accountKeeper.GetAccount(ctx, cosmosAddr)
        if acct == nil {
          return nil
        }
    
7.  The Account Keeper is implemented in the Cosmos SDK ([account.go#L41-L49](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/394f1b9478a8dc568d4bab079732932488b46704/x/auth/keeper/account.go#L41-L49)):
    
        func (ak AccountKeeper) GetAccount(ctx sdk.Context, addr sdk.AccAddress) types.AccountI {
          store := ctx.KVStore(ak.storeKey)
          bz := store.Get(types.AddressStoreKey(addr))
          if bz == nil {
            return nil
          }
        
          return ak.decodeAccount(bz)
        }
    
8.  It basically reads an account from the store passed in the context object ([context.go#L280-L282](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/394f1b9478a8dc568d4bab079732932488b46704/types/context.go#L280-L282));
9.  In the Account Keeper, there’s also `SetAccount` function ([account.go#L72](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/394f1b9478a8dc568d4bab079732932488b46704/x/auth/keeper/account.go#L72)), and it’s called in Ethermint by the EVM Keeper ([statedb.go#L126](https://github.com/evmos/ethermint/blob/f7f1e1c18c64c912e7b5d524ae710e542b47e02a/x/evm/keeper/statedb.go#L126));
10.  The EVM Keeper’s `SetAccount` is called when transaction changes are committed to the state database ([statedb.go#L449](https://github.com/evmos/ethermint/blob/f7f1e1c18c64c912e7b5d524ae710e542b47e02a/x/evm/statedb/statedb.go#L449));
11.  The state database is a set of state objects, where keys are account addresses and values are accounts themselves;
12.  The `getOrNewStateObject` function initializes new state objects ([statedb.go#L221-L227](https://github.com/evmos/ethermint/blob/f7f1e1c18c64c912e7b5d524ae710e542b47e02a/x/evm/statedb/statedb.go#L221-L227));
13.  `getOrNewStateObject` is only called by these functions: `AddBalance`, `SubBalance`, `SetNonce`, `SetCode`, `SetState` ([statedb.go#L290-L328](https://github.com/evmos/ethermint/blob/f7f1e1c18c64c912e7b5d524ae710e542b47e02a/x/evm/statedb/statedb.go#L290-L328)).

Thus, a new account object in the state database is only created when an address receives native coins, sends a transaction (which increases the nonce), or when contract code is deployed at it.

**Example Exploit Scenario**

1.  Alice deploys a smart contract that attracts a lot of users.
2.  Alice registers the contract in Turnstile. As a recipient contract for the NFT, Alice decides to use a dedicated address that hasn’t been used for anything else before (hasn’t received coins, hasn’t sent a transaction, etc.).
3.  The `register` function call succeeds and Alice’s contract gets registered in Turnstile.
4.  However, due to the “only existing recipient account” check on the consensus layer, Alice’s contract wasn’t registered on the consensus layer and doesn’t earn fees.
5.  Since `register` and `assign` can only be called once (due to the `onlyUnregistered` modifier), Alice cannot re-register her contract. She can transfer the NFT to a different address, however this won’t make the contract registered on the consensus layer and the owner of the NFT will never receive fees.

### [](#recommended-mitigation-steps-1)Recommended Mitigation Steps

Consider removing the “only existing recipient account” check in the `RegisterEvent` handler since it creates a discrepancy between the application and the consensus layers. Otherwise, if it’s mandatory that receiver addresses are not fresh, consider returning an error in the `PostTxProcessing` hook (which will revert a transaction) if there was an error during events processing.

### [](#impact-1)Impact

Some contracts and some Turnstile tokens (NFTs) will not be able to receive CSR fees forever.

### [](#proof-of-concept-2)Proof of Concept

In evm_hooks.go, the \[PostTxProcessing\]([https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-11-canto/blob/2733fdd1bee73a6871c6243f92a007a0b80e4c61/Canto/x/csr/keeper/evm](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-11-canto/blob/2733fdd1bee73a6871c6243f92a007a0b80e4c61/Canto/x/csr/keeper/evm)_hooks.go#L49) will call `h.processEvents(ctx, receipt)` to handle `Register` and `Assign` events from Turnstile contract first:

    h.processEvents(ctx, receipt)

Notice that the `processEvents` function does not return any error.

However, it is possible for [processEvents](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-11-canto/blob/2733fdd1bee73a6871c6243f92a007a0b80e4c61/Canto/x/csr/keeper/evm_hooks.go#L101-L135) to encounter an error:

    func (h Hooks) processEvents(ctx sdk.Context, receipt *ethtypes.Receipt) {
      ...
      for _, log := range receipt.Logs {
        ...
        if log.Address == turnstileAddress {
          ...
          switch event.Name {
          case types.TurnstileEventRegister:
            err = h.k.RegisterEvent(ctx, log.Data)
          case types.TurnstileEventUpdate:
            err = h.k.UpdateEvent(ctx, log.Data)
          }
          if err != nil {
            h.k.Logger(ctx).Error(err.Error())
            return
          }
        }
      }
    }

According to the above implementation of `processEvents`, it will process all the events emitted by the transaction one by one. If one of them encounters an error, it will return directly without any error, and any subsequent unprocessed events will be ignored.

Suppose we have a transaction containing the following events (by contract calls):

1.  Register C1 with token1
2.  Register C2 with token2
3.  Assign C3 with token1

If `RegisterEvent()` returns an error when handling the first event, then all of the events will not be handled because `processEvents()` will return after logging the error.

And `PostTxProcessing()` continues to execute normally because it is unaware of the error.

According to the current implementation of [`RegisterEvent()`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-11-canto/blob/main/Canto/x/csr/keeper/event_handler.go#L16) and [`UpdateEvent`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-11-canto/blob/main/Canto/x/csr/keeper/event_handler.go#L62), they are both easy to encounter an error. Like `register()` using a recipient that doesn’t exist yet.

As a result, none of the C1, C2, C3 contracts will be able to receive any CSR fee because they are not recorded in csr store.

Contracts C1, C2, C3 will never be able to register for CSR because they are marked registered in Turnstile contract (evm store) and will be reverted by `onlyUnregistered` when calling `register()` or `assign()`.

And all other contracts calling `assign(token1)` or `assign(token2)` will enter the same state as C1/C2/C3, because the `assign()` will succeed in Turnstile contract but fail in [`UpdateEvent()`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-11-canto/blob/2733fdd1be/Canto/x/csr/keeper/event_handler.go#L75-L80) (because the store can not find token1 or token2):

      // Check if the NFT that is being updated exists in the CSR store
      nftID := event.TokenId.Uint64()
      csr, found := k.GetCSR(ctx, nftID)
      if !found {
      	return sdkerrors.Wrapf(ErrNFTNotFound, "EventHandler::UpdateEvent the nft entered does not currently exist: %d", nftID)
      }

### [](#tools-used)Tools Used

### [](#recommended-mitigation-steps-2)Recommended Mitigation Steps

`processEvents()` should return the error it encounters, and `PostTxProcessing()` should return that error too.

> If there are multiple TXs registering contracts, but one of them fails, all of them will fail without much of a warning, so issue confirmed. Although, instead of returning the error to revert the TX, the error should be logged and the for loop inside of processEvents should be allowed to continue.

### [](#impact-2)Impact

Any transaction, even those that don’t interact with the Turnstile contract, can be reverted by the `PostTxProcessing` hook if there was a CSR specific error. Thus, the CSR module can impair the behavior of smart contracts not related to the module.

### [](#proof-of-concept-3)Proof of Concept

The `PostTxProcessing` is used by the keeper to register contracts with the CSR module and distribute gas fees to registered contracts ([evm\_hooks.go#L41](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-11-canto/blob/2733fdd1bee73a6871c6243f92a007a0b80e4c61/Canto/x/csr/keeper/evm_hooks.go#L41)). The hook can return an error while handling CSR specific operations:

*   Reading a CSR object from the storage ([evm\_hooks.go#L61-L64](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-11-canto/blob/2733fdd1bee73a6871c6243f92a007a0b80e4c61/Canto/x/csr/keeper/evm_hooks.go#L61-L64));
*   Sending gas fees to the module ([evm\_hooks.go#L73-L76](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-11-canto/blob/2733fdd1bee73a6871c6243f92a007a0b80e4c61/Canto/x/csr/keeper/evm_hooks.go#L73-L76));
*   Reading the address of Turnstile ([evm\_hooks.go#L79-L82](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-11-canto/blob/2733fdd1bee73a6871c6243f92a007a0b80e4c61/Canto/x/csr/keeper/evm_hooks.go#L79-L82));
*   Calling the `distributeFees` function ([evm\_hooks.go#L85-L89](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-11-canto/blob/2733fdd1bee73a6871c6243f92a007a0b80e4c61/Canto/x/csr/keeper/evm_hooks.go#L85-L89)).

In case any of these operations fails, the whole transaction will be reverted ([state\_transition.go#L272-L278](https://github.com/evmos/ethermint/blob/37e394f309808d911b6c7d7eaf1e0c7a9cc1c70b/x/evm/keeper/state_transition.go#L272-L278)):

    if err = k.PostTxProcessing(tmpCtx, msg, receipt); err != nil {
      // If hooks return error, revert the whole tx.
      res.VmError = types.ErrPostTxProcessing.Error()
      k.Logger(ctx).Error("tx post processing failed", "error", err)

One example of when the hook can revert in normal circumstances is when the fees to be distributed are 0, which can be caused by a combination of low gas usage of a transaction, a small CSR share, and rounding (the fees are a share of the gas spent to execute a transaction: [evm\_hooks.go#L66-L70](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-11-canto/blob/2733fdd1bee73a6871c6243f92a007a0b80e4c61/Canto/x/csr/keeper/evm_hooks.go#L66-L70)). In this case, the `distributeFees` call will revert and will cause the whole transaction to be reverted as well ([evm\_hooks.go#L86-L89](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-11-canto/blob/2733fdd1bee73a6871c6243f92a007a0b80e4c61/Canto/x/csr/keeper/evm_hooks.go#L86-L89), [Turnstile.sol#L149](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-11-canto/blob/2733fdd1bee73a6871c6243f92a007a0b80e4c61/CIP-001/src/Turnstile.sol#L149)).

### [](#recommended-mitigation-steps-3)Recommended Mitigation Steps

In the `PostTxProcessing` hook, consider always logging errors and returning `nil` to avoid impairing user transactions. Also, consider logging a fatal error and exiting when the module cannot function due to an error.

### [](#impact-3)Impact

There is no re-register or re-assign option for the smart contracts.

Let’s assume a smart contract is registered either through the `register()` function with a new NFT minted or the `assign()` function to an existing NFT.

However, if somehow, the NFT is burned by the owner or transferred to another owner either by an approval or compromised tx, there is no option to re-register for these contracts which create gas fees but might not get a fee distribution in return.

And if the NFT is burned or transferred to another owner, the smart contracts will lose the fees generated if not previously withdrawn.

[https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-11-canto/blob/main/CIP-001/src/Turnstile.sol#L148](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-11-canto/blob/main/CIP-001/src/Turnstile.sol#L148)

Typically, the contract’s `onlyOwner` is the account that deploys the contract. As a result, the `onlyOwner` is able to perform certain privileged activities.

However, `onlyOwner` privileges are numerous and there is no timelock structure in the process of using these privileges.

The onlyOwner is assumed to be an EOA, since the documents do not provide information on whether the `onlyOwner` will be a multisign structure.

In parallel with the private key thefts of the project onlyOwners, which have increased recently, this vulnerability has been stated as Medium.

Similar vulnerability;

`onlyonlyOwner` powers;

    Canto/contracts/turnstile.sol:

`onlyOwner` can also make this functionality unavailable by using the renounceOwnership property.

### [](#recommended-mitigation-steps-5)Recommended Mitigation Steps

1.  A timelock contract should be added to use `onlyOwner` privileges. In this way, users can be warned in case of a possible security weakness.
2.  `onlyOwner` can be a Multisign wallet and this part is specified in the documentation.

[Turnstile.sol#L4](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-11-canto/blob/main/CIP-001/src/Turnstile.sol#L4)

Typically, the contract’s owner is the account that deploys the contract. As a result, the owner is able to perform certain privileged activities.

The Openzeppelin’s Ownable used in this project contract implements renounceOwnership. This can represent a certain risk if the ownership is renounced for any other reason than by design. Renouncing ownership will leave the contract without an owner, thereby removing any functionality that is only available to the owner.

Ether transfer is done with `Address.sendValue(_recipient, _amount);` in the `withdraw` function, OZ’s Address.sol library is used

    Canto/contracts/turnstile.sol:
      127      /// @return amount of fees withdrawn

      145:     }

There is this warning in OZ’s Address.sol library. Accordingly, he used the Check-Effect-Interaction pattern in the project:

    * IMPORTANT: because control is transferred to `recipient`, care must be
          * taken to not create reentrancy vulnerabilities. Consider using
          * {ReentrancyGuard} or the

          */

It would be best practice to use re-entrancy Guard for reasons such as complicated dangers such as view Re-Entrancy that emerged in the last period and the possibility of expanding the project and its integration with other contracts:

[](#l-06-no-check-if-onerc721received-is-implemented)\[L-06\] No Check if OnErc721Received is implemented
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

`Turnstile.register()` will mint a NFT . When minting a NFT, the function does not check if a receiving contract implements `onERC721Received()`.

`_recipient` can be contract address.

The intention behind this function is to check if the address receiving the NFT. If it is a contract, implements `onERC721Received()`. Thus, there is no check whether the receiving address supports ERC-721 tokens and position could be not transferrable in some cases.

Following shows that `_mint` is used instead of `_safeMint`:

    Canto/contracts/turnstile.sol:
       86      /// @return tokenId of the ownership NFT that collects fees
       87:     function register(address _recipient) public onlyUnregistered returns (uint256 tokenId) {
       88:         address smartContract = msg.sender;
       89: 
       90:         if (_recipient == address(0)) revert InvalidRecipient();
       91:

Solidity code is also cleaner in another way that might not be noticeable: the struct Point. We were importing it previously with global import but not using it. The Point struct `polluted the source code` with an unnecessary object we were not using because we did not need it.

This was breaking the rule of modularity and modular programming: `only import what you need`. Specific imports with curly braces allow us to apply this rule better.

Order of Functions; ordering helps readers identify which functions they can call and to find the constructor and fallback definitions easier. But there are contracts in the project that do not comply with this.

[https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.17/style-guide.html](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.17/style-guide.html)

Functions should be grouped according to their visibility and ordered:

constructor

external

public

internal

private

Within a grouping, place the view and pure functions last.

[](#n-06-add-a-timelock-to-critical-functions)\[N-06\] Add a timelock to critical functions
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

It is a good practice to give time for users to react and adjust to critical changes. A timelock provides more guarantees and reduces the level of trust required, thus decreasing risk for users. It also indicates that the project is legitimate (less risk of a malicious owner making a sandwich attack on a user).

Consider adding a timelock to:

[https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-11-canto/blob/main/CIP-001/src/Turnstile.sol#L12](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-11-canto/blob/main/CIP-001/src/Turnstile.sol#L12) [Turnstile.sol#L12](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-11-canto/blob/main/CIP-001/src/Turnstile.sol#L12)

For the imported contracts containing critical functions (TransferOwnerShip, RenounOwnerShip etc.), add timelock to them.

[](#n-07-take-advantage-of-custom-errors-return-value-property)\[N-07\] Take advantage of Custom Error’s return value property
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

An important feature of Custom Error is that values such as address, tokenID, msg.value can be written inside the `()` sign, this kind of approach provides a serious advantage in debugging and examining the revert details of dapps such as tenderly.

For Example:

    CIP-001/src/Turnstile.sol:
      110      /// @return tokenId of the ownership NFT that collects fees
      111:     function assign(uint256 _tokenId) public onlyUnregistered returns (uint256) {
      112:         address smartContract = msg.sender;
      113: 
    - 114:         if (!_exists(_tokenId)) revert InvalidTokenId();

[](#n-08-using-vulnerable-version-of-openzeppelin)\[N-08\] Using Vulnerable Version of OpenZeppelin

The package.json configuration file says that the project is using 4.7.0 of OpenZeppelin which has a vulnerability.

Although there is no security vulnerability covering the project, it is recommended to use the latest version 4.7.3.

[](#n-09-import-only-the-parts-you-use)\[N-09\] Import only the parts you use

Besides `isRegistered` function, `registered` is never used. The flag is only 1bit, but it allocates an entire extra storage slot for every call to `register` or `assign`. `SSTORE` opcode cost up to 20000 gas for uninitialized slots like these.

Removing this flag reduces the total storage needed by 50% for each allocation on `feeRecipient` mapping, resulting in gas reductions for `register` and `assign` functions.

Using `ERC721Enumerable` is known to incur large gas overheads, as the Turnstile contract already manage the `TokenId` by itself (using `Counters.Counter`) and does not use any of the extra functionality present in `ERC721Enumerable` (e.g `totalSupply()`, `tokenByIndex(index)`, `tokenOfOwnerByIndex(owner, index)`). We can safely change to vanilla `ERC721`.

[](#g-03-leave-1-wei-in-balance-after-withdraw)\[G-03\] Leave 1 wei in `balance` after `withdraw`
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Every time that a user withdraws all their balance, their storage slot on the `balance` mapping is freed, refunding gas to the caller. However the next call to `distributeFees` on this same user balance would require the storage slot to be re-initialized, which incurs high gas cost.

This effect is dependent on users mainly withdrawing their full balances, which seems the most probable behaviour, as there is no incentive to keep any balance left on the Turnstile contract. Considering this user behaviour, modifying the `withdraw` function to leave 1 wei in storage can result in a net reduction of gas.

\* These values are from a simulation of 10 sucessive (full `withdraw` followed by `distributeFees`) sequences.

Note that while there is a net reduction of gas, it is heavily skewed to the contract owner (who is the sole caller of `distributeFees`). While users would be affected negatively as the `withdraw` gas cost would be increased.
