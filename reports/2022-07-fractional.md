[](#about-c4)About C4
---------------------

Code4rena (C4) is an open organization consisting of security researchers, auditors, developers, and individuals with domain expertise in smart contracts.

A C4 audit contest is an event in which community participants, referred to as Wardens, review, audit, or analyze smart contract logic in exchange for a bounty provided by sponsoring projects.

During the audit contest outlined in this document, C4 conducted an analysis of the Fractional v2 smart contract system written in Solidity. The audit contest took place between July 7—July 14 2022.

This contest was judged by [HardlyDifficult](https://twitter.com/HardlyDifficult).

Final report assembled by [itsmetechjay](https://twitter.com/itsmetechjay).

[](#summary)Summary
===================

The C4 analysis yielded an aggregated total of 32 unique vulnerabilities. Of these vulnerabilities, 20 received a risk rating in the category of HIGH severity and 12 received a risk rating in the category of MEDIUM severity.

Additionally, C4 analysis included 97 reports detailing issues with a risk rating of LOW severity or non-critical. There were also 76 reports recommending gas optimizations.

All of the issues presented here are linked back to their original finding.

[](#scope)Scope
===============

The code under review can be found within the [C4 Fractional v2 contest repository](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-07-fractional), and is composed of 37 smart contracts written in the Solidity programming language and includes 2,260 lines of Solidity code.

[](#severity-criteria)Severity Criteria
=======================================

C4 assesses the severity of disclosed vulnerabilities according to a methodology based on [OWASP standards](https://owasp.org/www-community/OWASP_Risk_Rating_Methodology).

Vulnerabilities are divided into three primary risk categories: high, medium, and low/non-critical.

High-level considerations for vulnerabilities span the following key areas when conducting assessments:

*   Malicious Input Handling
*   Escalation of privileges
*   Arithmetic
*   Gas use

Further information regarding the severity criteria referenced throughout the submission review process, please refer to the documentation provided on [the C4 website](https://code4rena.com).

### [](#vulnerability-details)Vulnerability Details

This is a basic uninitialized proxy bug, the `VaultFactory` creates a single implementation of `Vault` and then creates a proxy to that implementation every time a new vault needs to be deployed.

The problem is that that implementation vault is not initialized , which means that anybody can initialize the contract to become the owner, and then destroy it by doing a delegate call (via the `execute` function) to a function with the `selfdestruct` opcode. Once the implementation is destroyed all of the vaults will be unusable. And since there’s no logic in the proxies to update the implementation - that means this is permanent (i.e. there’s no way to call any function on any vault anymore, they’re simply dead).

### [](#impact)Impact

This is a critical bug, since ALL assets held by ALL vaults will be lost. There’s no way to transfer them out and there’s no way to run any function on any vault.

Also, there’s no way to fix the current deployed contracts (modules and registry), since they all depend on the factory vault, and there’s no way to update them to a different factory. That means Fractional would have to deploy a new set of contracts after fixing the bug (this is a relatively small issue though).

### [](#proof-of-concept)Proof of Concept

I created the PoC based on the `scripts/deploy.js` file, here’s a stripped-down version of that:

    const { ethers } = require("hardhat");
    
    const ZERO_ADDRESS = "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000";
    
    async function main() {
        const [deployer, attacker] = await ethers.getSigners();
    
        // Get all contract factories
        const BaseVault = await ethers.getContractFactory("BaseVault");
        const Supply = await ethers.getContractFactory("Supply");
        const VaultRegistry = await ethers.getContractFactory("VaultRegistry");
    
        // Deploy contracts
    
        const registry = await VaultRegistry.deploy();
        await registry.deployed();
    
        const supply = await Supply.deploy(registry.address);
        await supply.deployed();
    
        // notice that the `factory` var in the original `deploy.js` file is a different factory than the registry's
        const registryVaultFactory = await ethers.getContractAt("VaultFactory", await registry.factory());
    
        const implVaultAddress = await registryVaultFactory.implementation();
        const vaultImpl = await ethers.getContractAt("Vault", implVaultAddress);
    
        const baseVault = await BaseVault.deploy(registry.address, supply.address);
        await baseVault.deployed();
        // proxy vault - the vault that's used by the user
        let proxyVault = await deployVault(baseVault, registry, attacker);

Sidenote: as the comment in the code says, we don’t really need to transfer the ownership to the zero address. It’s just that Foundry’s `forge` did revert the destruction when I didn’t do it, with the error of `OwnerChanged` (i.e. once the `selfdestruct` was called the owner became the zero address, which is different than the original owner) so I decided to add this just in case. This is probably a bug in `forge`, since the contract shouldn’t destruct till the end of the tx (Hardhat indeed didn’t revert the destruction even when the attacker was the owner).

### [](#tools-used)Tools Used

### [](#recommended-mitigation-steps)Recommended Mitigation Steps

Add init in `Vault`’s constructor (and make the `init` function `public` instead of `external`):

    contract Vault is IVault, NFTReceiver {
        /// @notice Address of vault owner
        address public owner;
        /// ...
    
        constructor(){
            // initialize implementation
            init();
        }
    
        /// @dev Initializes nonce and proxy owner
        function init() public {

Alternately you can add init in `VaultFactory.sol` constructor, but I think initializing in the contract itself is a better practice.

        /// @notice Initializes implementation contract
        constructor() {
            implementation = address(new Vault());
            Vault(implementation).init();
        }

After mitigation the PoC will output this:

    Error: VM Exception while processing transaction: reverted with custom error 'Initialized("0xa16E02E87b7454126E5E10d957A927A7F5B5d2be", "0x70997970C51812dc3A010C7d01b50e0d17dc79C8", 1)'

_Submitted by cccz_

In the end function of the Buyout contract, when the buyout fails, ERC1155 tokens are sent to the proposer. A malicious proposer can start a buyout using a contract that cannot receive ERC1155 tokens, and if the buyout fails, the end function fails because it cannot send ERC1155 tokens to the proposer. This prevents a new buyout from being started.

### [](#vulnerability-details-1)Vulnerability Details

In Migration, when joining or leaving a migration proposal, Fractional does not check whether the user supplied `proposalId` and `vault` match the actual vault that the proposal belongs to.

This allows the user to trick the accounting.

### [](#impact-1)Impact

Loss of funds for users.

Malicious users can withdraw tokens from proposals which have not been committed yet.

### [](#proof-of-concept-2)Proof of Concept

Let’s say Vault A’s FERC1155 token is called TOKEN. Alice has deposited 100 TOKEN in Migration to Vault A on proposal ID 1.

Now Malaclypse creates Vault B with token ERIS as FERC1155 and mints 100 tokens to himself. He then calls Migration’s `join` with amount as 100, Vault B as `vault`, proposal ID as 1. The function [will get](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-07-fractional/blob/main/src/modules/Migration.sol#L111) ERIS as the token to deposit. It [will pull](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-07-fractional/blob/main/src/modules/Migration.sol#L126) the ERIS from Mal. And now for the problem - it [will set](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-07-fractional/blob/main/src/modules/Migration.sol#L135) the following variable:

            userProposalFractions[_proposalId][msg.sender] += _amount;

Notice that this does not correspond to the vault number.

Now, Mal will call the `leave` function, this time with Vault A address and proposal ID 1. The function [will get](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-07-fractional/blob/main/src/modules/Migration.sol#L143) the token to send from the vault as TOKEN.

It [will get](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-07-fractional/blob/main/src/modules/Migration.sol#L155) the amount to withdraw from `userProposalFractions[_proposalId][msg.sender]`, which as we saw previously will be 100.

It will [deduct](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-07-fractional/blob/main/src/modules/Migration.sol#L156) this amount from `migrationInfo[_vault][_proposalId]`, which won’t revert as Alice deposited 100 to this vault and proposal.

And finally [it will send](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-07-fractional/blob/main/src/modules/Migration.sol#L164) 100 TOKENs to Mal - although he deposited ERIS.

Mal received Alice’s valuable tokens.

### [](#recommended-mitigation-steps-2)Recommended Mitigation Steps

I think that one option would be to save for each proposal which vault it corresponds to. Then you can verify that user supplies a matching vault-proposal pair, or he can even just supply proposal and the contract will get the vault from that.

Another solution would be to have `userProposalFractions` save the relevant vault also, not just a general proposal id.

_Submitted by 0xA5DF, also found by 0x52, exd0tpy, horsefacts, hyh, kenzo, Lambda, minhquanym, panprog, scaraven, shenwilly, and simon135_

Divisions in EVM are rounded down, which means when the fraction price is close to 1 (e.g. 0.999) it would effectively be zero, when it’s close to 2 (1.999) it would be rounded to 1 - losing close to 50% of the intended price.

*   In case the proposer had any fractions, the buyout module puts them for sale and he can lose his fractions while getting in exchange either zero or a significantly lower price than intended
*   Even when the proposer doesn’t hold any fractions, if the buyout succeeds - the difference (i.e. `buyoutPrice - fractionPrice*totalSupply`) goes to those who cash out their fractions after the buyout ends.
    
    *   That’s going to disincentivize users to sell their fractions during the buyout, because they may get more if they keep it till the buyout ends.
    *   In other words, not only that the extra money the proposer paid doesn’t increase the chance of the buyout to succeed, it actually decreases it.

*   Request the user to send the intended fraction price (as a function arg) and then make sure he sent enough ETH. This way the user is well aware of the fraction price.
*   An advantage of this method is that the buyout price calculation is also more accurate (compared to `(msg.value * 100) /(100 - ((depositAmount * 100) / totalSupply))` which has a rounding of up to 1%)
*   Optional - you can also refund the user if he sent too much ETH, though this is probably unnecessary since the UI should calculate the exact amount the user should send.

#### [](#solution-b-calculate-the-price-at-buysell-time-using-buyoutprice)Solution B: Calculate the price at buy/sell time using `buyoutPrice`

*   The problem with solution A is that it doesn’t let much flexibility in case that total supply is large. In the example in the PoC (`totalSupply = 2.1e18`) the buyout price can be either 2.1 ETH or 4.2 ETH, if the user wants to offer 1.5 ETH or 3 ETH he can’t do it.
*   This solution solves this - instead of basing the buy/sell price on the fraction price - use the buyout price to calculate the buy/sell price.
*   This would cause a slight differential price (buying 1K fractions would have a slightly different price than 1M fractions).
    
    *   However, note that the rounding here is probably insignificant, since the rounding would be no more than 1 wei per buy/sell
    *   Also, the more the users buy/sell the more accurate the price would be (the less you buy the more you’ll pay, the less you sell the less you’d get).
*   For selling just calculate `price = (buyoutPrice * amount) / totalSupply`
*   For buying do the same, just add 1 wei if there was any rounding (see code below)
*   If you’re worried about the rounding of the buyout price (compared to solution A), you can increase the coefficient (this doesn’t cost any extra gas, and is nearly impossible to overflow):

### [](#vulnerability-details-2)Vulnerability Details

When a user calls `withdrawContribution`, it will try to send him back his original contribution for the proposal.

But if the proposal has been committed, and other users have interacted with the buyout, Migration will receive back a different amount of ETH and tokens.

Therefore it shouldn’t send the user back his original contribution, but should send whatever his share is of whatever was received back from Buyout.

### [](#impact-2)Impact

Loss of funds for users. Some users might not be able to withdraw their contribution at all, and other users might withdraw funds that belong to other users. (This can also be done as a purposeful attack.)

### [](#proof-of-concept-4)Proof of Concept

A summary is described at the top.

It’s probably not needed, but here’s the flow in detail. When a user joins a proposal, Migration [saves](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-07-fractional/blob/main/src/modules/Migration.sol#L124:#L135) his contribution:

            userProposalEth[_proposalId][msg.sender] += msg.value;
            userProposalFractions[_proposalId][msg.sender] += _amount;

Later when the user would want to withdraw his contribution from a failed migration, Migration would [refer](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-07-fractional/blob/main/src/modules/Migration.sol#L308:#L325) to these same variables to decide how much to send to the user:

            uint256 userFractions = userProposalFractions[_proposalId][msg.sender];
            IFERC1155(token).safeTransferFrom(address(this), msg.sender, id, userFractions, "");
            uint256 userEth = userProposalEth[_proposalId][msg.sender];
            payable(msg.sender).transfer(userEth);

But if the proposal was committed, and other users interacted with the buyout, then the amount of ETH and tokens that Buyout sends back is not the same contribution.

For example, if another user called `buyFractions` for the buyout, it [will decrease](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-07-fractional/blob/main/src/modules/Buyout.sol#L168) the amount of tokens in the pool:

            IERC1155(token).safeTransferFrom(address(this), msg.sender, id, _amount, "");

And when the proposal will end, if it has failed, Buyout will [send back](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-07-fractional/blob/main/src/modules/Buyout.sol#L228) to Migration [the amount](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-07-fractional/blob/main/src/modules/Buyout.sol#L206) of tokens in the pool:

            uint256 tokenBalance = IERC1155(token).balanceOf(address(this), id);
            ...
            IERC1155(token).safeTransferFrom(address(this), proposer, id, tokenBalance, "");

(\*\*Same will happen for the ETH amount)

Therefore, Migration will receive back less tokens than the original contribution. When the user will try to call `withdrawContribution` to withdraw his contribution from the pool, Migration would [try to send](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-07-fractional/blob/main/src/modules/Migration.sol#L310) the user’s original contribution. But there’s a deficit of that. If other users have contributed the same token, then it will transfer their tokens to the user. If not, then the withdrawal will simply revert for insufficient balance.

### [](#recommended-mitigation-steps-4)Recommended Mitigation Steps

I am not sure, but I think that the correct solution would be that upon a failed proposal’s end, there should be a hook call from Buyout to the proposer - in our situation, Migration. Migration would then see(/receive as parameter) how much ETH/tokens were received, and update the proposal with the change needed. eg. send to each user 0.5 his tokens and 1.5 his ETH.

In another issue I submitted, “User can’t withdraw assets from failed migration if another buyout is going on/succeeded”, I described for a different reason why such a callback to Migration might be needed. Please see there for more implementation suggestions.

I think this issue shows that indeed it is needed.

### [](#impact-3)Impact

When buyout starts, it takes all fractions owned by proposer. This means that when `Migration` contract starts a buyout, it takes all fractions it has, not just the fractions from the proposal. This is easily exploitable by anyone.

Stealing fractions scenario:

1.  Bob starts a proposal, deposits `3000` fractions
2.  Alice immediately starts another proposal with `targetPrice = 0`, deposits `0 fractions` and minimal ether (`value: 1`, which is `10^-18 ether`)
3.  Since price is larger than targetPrice, Alice immediately commits the proposal
4.  Buyout is started, but instead of `0 fractions` it has `3000 fractions` from bob, because starting buyout took all `Migration`’s fractions.
5.  Alice immediately buys `3000 fractions` from buyout for free (`0 ether`).
6.  At this point Alice has successfully stolen all deposited fractions.

### [](#proof-of-concept-5)Proof of Concept

Add this code to test/Migration.t.sol

    function testPanprogBugH4() public {
    	initializeMigration(alice, bob, 10000, 10000, true);
    
    	(nftReceiverSelectors, nftReceiverPlugins) = initializeNFTReceiver();
    	// Migrate to a vault with no permissions (just to test out migration)
    	address[] memory newModules = new address[](2);
    
    	newModules[0] = migration;
    	newModules[1] = modules[1];
    
    	// Bob makes the proposal
    	bob.migrationModule.propose(
    		vault,
    		newModules,
    		nftReceiverPlugins,
    		nftReceiverSelectors,
    		TOTAL_SUPPLY * 2,
    		10 ether
    	);
    	// Bob joins the proposal with 3000 fractions
    	bob.migrationModule.join{value: 1 ether}(vault, 1, 3000);
    
    	// Alice starts a competing proposal (we use bob's data for simplicity)
    	alice.migrationModule.propose(
    		vault,
    		newModules,
    		nftReceiverPlugins,
    		nftReceiverSelectors,
    		TOTAL_SUPPLY * 10,
    		0 ether
    	);
    
    	// Alice joins her proposal with 0 fractions and minimum allowed ether (for the price to be above target)
    	alice.migrationModule.join{value: 1}(vault, 2, 0);
    
    	// since the target price is reached, alice starts the buyout on her proposal
    	alice.migrationModule.commit(vault, 2);
    
    	// at this point buyout should be empty, but in fact due to bug it has 3000 fractions from bob
    	// alice can now buy fractions from buyout for free (it should revert, but it doesn't)
    	vm.expectRevert(
    		abi.encodeWithSelector(IBuyout.InvalidPayment.selector)
    	);
    	alice.buyoutModule.buyFractions(vault, 3000);
    }

### [](#recommended-mitigation-steps-5)Recommended Mitigation Steps

`Buyout` `start` function should include amount of fractions a proposer deposits, and `Migration`’s `commit` function should specify correct fractions amount when starting a buyout.

### [](#impact-4)Impact

A user can start a perpetual buyout that cannot be stopped except by making the buyout succeed. This can be done by creating a malicious contract that will call back to `start` when it receives ETH via its `receive` function. The user then starts the perpetual buyout by calling `start` from the malicious contract.

Assume the rejection period has passed and the auction pool is not large enough (i.e. < 50%). If `end` is called then the method `_sendEthOrWeth` will attempt to send ETH to the malicious contract. The contract will simply call back to `start` sending the ETH it has just received.

The impact is that `end` can never be called on this buyout proposal if the buyout auction has failed. Worse, no new buyout proposal can be made since the current one is still live, and it is never in a state where it is not live.

The others users will either need to accept that assets are locked inside the vault, or that they will need to `sellFractions` in order to make the buyout succeed.

### [](#proof-of-concept-6)Proof of Concept

*   Each vault can only have one `buyoutInfo` associated with it as can be seen on [line 39](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-07-fractional/blob/8f2697ae727c60c93ea47276f8fa128369abfe51/src/modules/Buyout.sol#L39).
*   A new buyout proposal cannot be made unless the `buyoutInfo` state is `State.INACTIVE` as can be seen in [lines 66-68](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-07-fractional/blob/8f2697ae727c60c93ea47276f8fa128369abfe51/src/modules/Buyout.sol#L66-L68)
*   A proposer makes a proposal by calling `start`. They do this from a smart contract that simply calls `start` again when its `receive` function is called.
*   If the proposer fails to get over 50% then, when `end` is called, `_sendEthOrWeth` is called using the `proposer` value which is the smart contract that re-enters. See [line 235](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-07-fractional/blob/8f2697ae727c60c93ea47276f8fa128369abfe51/src/modules/Buyout.sol#L235). `_sendETHOrWeth` is cleverly written so that if `receive` were to revert the reversion would not “bubble up”. However, it does not protect against re-entrancy.
*   This means that `buyoutInfo[vault]` can never be overwritten. It is permanently stuck in state `State.LIVE` meaning that `start` can never be called for `vault` by anyone else.
*   The only way out of this conundrum is for the other users of the vault to `sellFractions` to make the auction succeed or to accept that assets are locked in the vault forever.

A [foundry test](https://github.com/sseefried/codearena-2022-07-fractional/blob/446fb54c6dbb0facfe40802a280de9e133f69589/test/BugsBuyout.t.sol#L45-L74) exhibiting this attack has been written in a private fork of the contest repo.

Note that `onERC1155Received` needs to be implemented in the malicious contract.

### [](#tools-used-2)Tools Used

Manual inspection + Foundry

### [](#recommended-mitigation-steps-6)Recommended Mitigation Steps

Prevent re-entrancy in the `start` function by using the `nonReentrant` modifier provided by OpenZeppelin’s [ReentrancyGuard](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/6ab8d6a67e3281ab062bdbe4df32b95c6409ee6d/contracts/security/ReentrancyGuard.sol) contract, or use an equivalent custom solution.

The function `Buyout.cash` allows a user to cash out proceeds (Ether) from a successful vault buyout.

However, due to how `buyoutShare` is calculated in `Buyout.cash`, users (fractional vault token holders) cashing out would receive more Ether than they are entitled to. The calculation is wrong as it uses the initial Ether balance stored in `buyoutInfo[_vault].ethBalance`. Each consecutive cash-out will lead to a user receiving more Ether, ultimately draining the Ether funds of the `Buyout` contract.

### [](#proof-of-concept-7)Proof of Concept

Copy paste the following test case into `Buyout.t.sol` and run the test via `forge test -vvv --match-test testCashDrainEther`:

The test shows how 2 users Alice and Eve cash out Ether from a successful vault buyout (which brought in `10 ether`). Alice and Eve are both entitled to receive `5 ether` each. Alice receives the correct amount when cashing out, however, due to a miscalculation of `buyoutShare` (see [#L268-L269](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-07-fractional/blob/8f2697ae727c60c93ea47276f8fa128369abfe51/src/modules/Buyout.sol#L268-L269)), Eve can cash-out `10 ether` from the `Buyout` contract.

      eve.buyoutModule.cash(vault, burnProof);
    }

**Additionally** to the demonstrated PoC in the test case, an attacker could intentionally create vaults with many wallets and exploit the vulnerability:

1.  Attacker deploys a vault with `10.000` fractions minted
2.  51% of fractions (`5.100`) are kept in the main wallet, all other fractions are distributed to 5 other self-controlled wallets (Wallets 1-5, `980` fractions each)
3.  With the first wallet, the attacker starts a buyout with `10 ether` - fractions are transferred into the `Buyout` contract as well as `10 ether`
4.  Attacker waits for `REJECTION_PERIOD` to elapse to call `Buyout.end` (51% of fractions are already held in the contract, therefore no need for voting)
5.  After the successful buyout, the attacker uses the `Buyout.cash` function to cash out each wallet. Each subsequent cash-out will lead to receiving more Ether, thus stealing Ether from the `Buyout` contract:
    
    1.  Wallet 1 - `buyoutShare = (980 * 10 ) / (3920 + 980) = 2 ether` (`totalSupply = 3920` after burning `980` fractions from wallet 1)
    2.  Wallet 2 - `buyoutShare = (980 * 10 ) / (2940 + 980) = 2.5 ether` (`totalSupply = 2940` after burning `980` fractions from wallet 2)
    3.  Wallet 3 - `buyoutShare = (980 * 10 ) / (1960 + 980) = ~3.3 ether` (`totalSupply = 1960` after burning `980` fractions from wallet 3)
    4.  Wallet 4 - `buyoutShare = (980 * 10 ) / (980 + 980) = 5 ether` (`totalSupply = 980` after burning `980` fractions from wallet 4)
    5.  Wallet 5 - `buyoutShare = (980 * 10 ) / (0 + 980) = 10 ether` (`totalSupply = 0` after burning `980` fractions from wallet 5)

If summed up, cashing out the 5 wallets, the attacker receives `22.8 ether` in total. Making a profit of `12.8 ether`.

This can be repeated and executed with multiple buyouts and vaults at the same time as long as there is Ether left to steal in the `Buyout` contract.

### [](#recommended-mitigation-steps-7)Recommended Mitigation Steps

Decrement `ethBalance` from buyout info `buyoutInfo[_vault].ethBalance -= buyoutShare;` in `Buyout.cash` (see `@audit-info` annotation):

    function cash(address _vault, bytes32[] calldata _burnProof) external {
        // Reverts if address is not a registered vault
        (address token, uint256 id) = IVaultRegistry(registry).vaultToToken(
            _vault
        );
        if (id == 0) revert NotVault(_vault);
        // Reverts if auction state is not successful
        (, , State current, , uint256 ethBalance, ) = this.buyoutInfo(_vault);
        State required = State.SUCCESS;
        if (current != required) revert InvalidState(required, current);
        // Reverts if caller has a balance of zero fractional tokens
        uint256 tokenBalance = IERC1155(token).balanceOf(msg.sender, id);
        if (tokenBalance == 0) revert NoFractions();
    
        // Initializes vault transaction
        bytes memory data = abi.encodeCall(
            ISupply.burn,
            (msg.sender, tokenBalance)
        );
        // Executes burn of fractional tokens from caller
        IVault(payable(_vault)).execute(supply, data, _burnProof);
    
        // Transfers buyout share amount to caller based on total supply
        uint256 totalSupply = IVaultRegistry(registry).totalSupply(_vault);
        uint256 buyoutShare = (tokenBalance * ethBalance) /
            (totalSupply + tokenBalance);
        buyoutInfo[_vault].ethBalance -= buyoutShare; // @audit-info decrement `ethBalance` by `buyoutShare`
        _sendEthOrWeth(msg.sender, buyoutShare);
        // Emits event for cashing out of buyout pool
        emit Cash(_vault, msg.sender, buyoutShare);
    }

### [](#background)Background

The following describes the migration process for a vault.

1.  Assume that Alice is the proposer.
2.  Alice calls `Migration.propose` to propose a set of modules and plugins to migrate a vault to
3.  Other contributors could join a migration proposal by contributing ether and fractional tokens by calling `Migration.join`.
4.  Alice calls `Migration.commit` to kick off the buyout process for a migration after the proposal period (7 days)
5.  If the buyout is successful, Alice calls the `Migration.settleVault` to settle a migration. Within this function, a new vault with new set permissions and plugins will be deployed.
6.  Alice calls the `Migration.settleFractions` to mint the fractional tokens for a new vault.
7.  Contributors who earlier joined the migration proposal could call the `Migration.migrateFractions` to migrate their fractional tokens from the old vault to the new vault.
8.  Finally, Alice will call `Migration.migrateVaultERC20`, `Migration.migrateVaultERC721`, and/or `Migration.migrateVaultERC1155` to transfer the ERC20, ERC721 (NFT), and/or ERC1155 tokens from the old vault to the new vault.

### [](#vulnerability-details-3)Vulnerability Details

It was observed that after a successful vault migration, an attacker could [`Migration.migrateVaultERC20`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-07-fractional/blob/8f2697ae727c60c93ea47276f8fa128369abfe51/src/modules/Migration.sol#L334), [`Migration.migrateVaultERC721`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-07-fractional/blob/8f2697ae727c60c93ea47276f8fa128369abfe51/src/modules/Migration.sol#L358), and/or [`Migration.migrateVaultERC1155`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-07-fractional/blob/8f2697ae727c60c93ea47276f8fa128369abfe51/src/modules/Migration.sol#L383) with an invalid `_proposalId` parameter, causing the assets within the vault to be burned.

### [](#proof-of-concept-8)Proof of Concept

> The PoC for `Migration.migrateVaultERC20`, `Migration.migrateVaultERC721`, and/or `Migration.migrateVaultERC1155` is the same. Thus, only the PoC for `Migration.migrateVaultERC721` is shown below, and the PoC for `migrateVaultERC20` and `migrateVaultERC1155` are omitted for brevity.

Assume that the following:

*   `vault A` holds only one (1) APE ERC721 NFT
*   Alice proposes to migrate `vault A` to a new vault, and the buyout is successful.
*   Alice proceeds to call `Migration.settleVault` to settle a migration, followed by `Migration.settleFractions` to mint the fractional tokens for a new vault.
*   An attacker calls `Migration.migrateVaultERC721(vault A, invalid_proposal_id, ape_nft_address, ape_nft_tokenId, erc721TransferProof)` with an invalid proposal ID (proposal ID that does not exist).
    
    *   Within the `Migration.migrateVaultERC721` function, the `newVault = migrationInfo[_vault][_proposalId].newVault` will evaluate to zero. This is because the `_proposalId` is a non-existent index in the `migrationInfo` array, so it will point to an address space that has not been initialised yet. Thus, the value `zero` will be returned, and `newVault` will be set to `address(0)`.
*   Next, the `Migration.migrateVaultERC721` function will attempt to transfer the ERC721 NFT from the old vault (`_vault`) to the new vault (`newVault`) by calling `IBuyout(buyout).withdrawERC721`. Since `newVault` is set to `address(0)`, this will cause the ERC721 NFT to be sent to `address(0)`, which effectively burns the NFT.

#### [](#additional-note-1---about-buyoutwithdrawerc721)Additional Note #1 - About `Buyout.withdrawERC721`

When a user proposes a migration, the user will kick off the buyout process after the proposal period. The `Migration` module will initiate the buyout on behalf of the user. Thus, the proposer of this buyout, in this case, would be the `Migration` module. Whenever `Buyout.withdrawERC721` function is called, it will verify that `msg.sender` is equal to the `proposer` to ensure that only the proposer who is the auction winner can migrate the assets from old vault to new vault.

In this example, the attacker has access to `Migration.migrateVaultERC20`, `Migration.migrateVaultERC721`, and/or `Migration.migrateVaultERC1155` functions that effectively instruct the `Migration` module to perform the withdrawal. In this case, it will pass the `if (msg.sender != proposer) revert NotWinner();` validation within the `Buyout.withdrawERC721` because the `msg.sender` is the `Migration` contract who initiates the buyout at the start.

[https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-07-fractional/blob/8f2697ae727c60c93ea47276f8fa128369abfe51/src/modules/Buyout.sol#L343](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-07-fractional/blob/8f2697ae727c60c93ea47276f8fa128369abfe51/src/modules/Buyout.sol#L343)

        address _vault,
        address _token,
        address _to,
        uint256 _tokenId,
        bytes32[] calldata _erc721TransferProof
    ) external {
        // Reverts if address is not a registered vault
        (, uint256 id) = IVaultRegistry(registry).vaultToToken(_vault);
        if (id == 0) revert NotVault(_vault);
        // Reverts if auction state is not successful
        (, address proposer, State current, , , ) = this.buyoutInfo(_vault);
        State required = State.SUCCESS;
        if (current != required) revert InvalidState(required, current);
        // Reverts if caller is not the auction winner

        );
        // Executes transfer of ERC721 token to caller
        ..SNIP..
    }

#### [](#additional-note-2---can-we-send-nft-to-address0)Additional Note #2 - Can we send NFT to address(0)?

Yes, it is possible to send NFT to `address(0)`.

If the ERC721 NFT contract uses [Openzeppelin’s ERC721 contract](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC721/ERC721.sol) or [Solmate’s ERC721 contract](https://github.com/Rari-Capital/solmate/blob/03e425421b24c4f75e4a3209b019b367847b7708/src/tokens/ERC721.sol#L89), then the NFT cannot be sent to `address(0)` because the contracts have implemented validation check to ensure that the `to` address is not `address(0)`.

However, not all the ERC721 NFT contracts use Openzeppelin or Solmate ERC721 implementation. Therefore, there will be a large number of custom implementations that allow NFT to be transferred to `address(0)`.

The same theory applies to ERC20 and ERC1155 implementations.

### [](#impact-5)Impact

Loss of assets for the users as the assets that they own can be burned by an attacker after a successful migration.

### [](#recommended-mitigation-steps-8)Recommended Mitigation Steps

It is recommended to implement additional validation to ensure that the `_proposalId` submitted is valid.

Consider checking if `newVault` points to a valid vault address before transferring the assets from old vault to new vault.

    function migrateVaultERC721(
        address _vault,
        uint256 _proposalId,
        address _token,
        uint256 _tokenId,
        bytes32[] calldata _erc721TransferProof
    ) external {
        address newVault = migrationInfo[_vault][_proposalId].newVault;
    +    if (newVault == address(0)) reverts VaultDoesNotExistOrInvalid;
        
        // Withdraws an ERC-721 token from the old vault and transfers to the new vault
        IBuyout(buyout).withdrawERC721(
            _vault,
            _token,
            newVault,
            _tokenId,
            _erc721TransferProof
        );
    }

In the above implementation, if anyone attempts to submit an invalid `_proposalId`, the `newVault` will be set to address(0). The newly implemented validation will detect the abnormal behavior and revert the transaction.

For defense-in-depth, perform additional validation to ensure that the `_to` address is not `address(0)` within the `Buyout.withdrawERC721` function.

    function withdrawERC721(
        address _vault,
        address _token,
        address _to,
        uint256 _tokenId,
        bytes32[] calldata _erc721TransferProof
    ) external {
        // Reverts if address is not a registered vault
        (, uint256 id) = IVaultRegistry(registry).vaultToToken(_vault);
        if (id == 0) revert NotVault(_vault);
    +   if (_to == 0) revert ToAddressIsZero(); 
        // Reverts if auction state is not successful
        (, address proposer, State current, , , ) = this.buyoutInfo(_vault);
        State required = State.SUCCESS;
        if (current != required) revert InvalidState(required, current);
        // Reverts if caller is not the auction winner
        if (msg.sender != proposer) revert NotWinner();
    
        // Initializes vault transaction
        bytes memory data = abi.encodeCall(
            ITransfer.ERC721TransferFrom,
            (_token, _vault, _to, _tokenId)
        );
        // Executes transfer of ERC721 token to caller
        IVault(payable(_vault)).execute(transfer, data, _erc721TransferProof);
    }

The same validation checks should be implemented on `migrateVaultERC20`, `migrateVaultERC1155`, `withdrawERC20` and `withdrawERC1155`

Steal NFTs from a Vault, and ETH + Fractional tokens from users.

### [](#description)Description

The `Migration.sol` module expects users to join a proposal using the `join` function, and leave a proposal using the `leave` function, both functions update fraction and ether balances of the proposal _and_ the caller.

The `withdrawContribution` function is meant to be used to retrieve ether and fractions deposited from an unsuccessful migration, but it can be called as well in proposals that have not been commited.

Unfortunately, the `withdrawContribution` function will issue a refund on fraction tokens and ether balances the user sent to a proposal but it will not update the variables `totalEth` and `totalFractions` (as `join` and `leave` do), leading to an inflation of ETH and fractional tokens if the user calls `join`, `withdrawContribution` and `join` again.

Exploiting this inflation bug, an attacker can steal all Ether and fractional tokens sent to a legit proposal by legit users of the community, and redirect them to an evil proposal that will win (because it has over 51% of token supply) and at the same time invalidate the legit proposal due to:

1- Lack of funds (they were stolen).

2- Only 1 LIVE proposal can be running at the same time.

A key element to take note is that only 1 proposal can be `LIVE`, but before a proposal goes `LIVE`, many can be created at the same time, and users can join those that resonate with them, sending their ETH and fractional tokens to support it. The vault will have a big amount of ETH and fractional tokens in these situations.

#### [](#steps-to-reproduce)Steps to reproduce

An attacker will exploit the inflation bug as follows:

1- Wait until there’s at least 50% of the total supply of fractional tokens in the vault, being stacked into one or several proposals.

2- Create an evil proposal with evil modules and inflate the amount of ETH and fractional tokens in your proposal up to the exact amount of the total ETH and fractional tokens in the vault.

3- Commit your proposal. That will send all ETH and fractional tokens in the vault to your proposal and `start` it.

Now that your proposal has over 51% total supply of fractional tokens in it and a lot of ETH stolen from members of the vault, many creative things can be done, including taking over the Vault’s NFTs with an evil module once the proposal goes through.

_NOTE: In the `REJECTION_PERIOD` victims can buy tokens to try to stop the proposal from going through, but the price of every tokens is calculated using the `depositAmount` and `msg.value` ([https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-07-fractional/blob/e2c5a962a94106f9495eb96769d7f60f7d5b14c9/src/modules/Buyout.sol#L86](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-07-fractional/blob/e2c5a962a94106f9495eb96769d7f60f7d5b14c9/src/modules/Buyout.sol#L86)) both values manipulated by the attacker._

### [](#proof-of-concept-9)Proof of Concept

The proof of concept took 4 hours and 33 mins to be written, as I tried hard to get a clean, and easy to understand and reproducible PoC that illustrates the impact of the attack.

Everything was put inside a function filled with comments at every stage, that can be included within the Unit Tests of the project.

You can read the PoC or include the function in `test/Migration.t.sol` and call `forge test -vvv --match-test testProposalAttack` to execute it.

        function testProposalAttack() public {
            initializeMigration(alice, bob, TOTAL_SUPPLY, HALF_SUPPLY, true);
            (nftReceiverSelectors, nftReceiverPlugins) = initializeNFTReceiver();
            address[] memory modules = new address[](1);
            modules[0] = address(mockModule);
    
            // STEP 0
            // The attacker waits until a proposal with over 51% joins and a nice amount of ETH is made
    
            // STEP 1
            // Alice makes a legit proposal
            alice.migrationModule.propose(
                vault,
                modules,
                nftReceiverPlugins,
                nftReceiverSelectors,
                TOTAL_SUPPLY * 2,
                1 ether

If the supply of the fraction is set to say 10 then any user that uses `migrateFractions` with less than 10% of the contributions will receive no shares at all due to precision loss. Under certain conditions it may even cause complete loss of access to the vault. In this same example, if less than 5 fractions can be redeemed (i.e. not enough people have more than 10% to overcome the precision loss) then the vault would never be able to be bought out and the vault would forever be frozen.

### [](#vulnerability-details-4)Vulnerability Details

A depositor cannot have any residual allowance after depositing to the vault because the tokens can be stolen by anyone.

### [](#proof-of-concept-11)Proof of Concept

Assume that Alice has finished deploying the vault, and she would like to deposit her ERC20, ERC721, and ERC1155 tokens to the vault. She currently holds the following assets in her wallet

*   `1000` XYZ ERC20 tokens
*   APE #1 ERC721 NFT, APE #2 ERC721 NFT, APE #3 ERC721 NFT,
*   `1000` ABC ERC1155 tokens

Thus, she sets up the necessary approval to grant [`baseVault`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-07-fractional/blob/8f2697ae727c60c93ea47276f8fa128369abfe51/src/modules/protoforms/BaseVault.sol#L17) contract the permission to transfer her tokens to the vault.

    erc20.approve(address(baseVault), type(uint256).max);
    erc721.setApprovalForAll(address(baseVault), true);
    erc1155.setApprovalForAll(address(baseVault), true);

Alice decided to deposit `50` XYZ ERC20 tokens, APE #1 ERC721 NFT, and `50` ABC tokens to the vault by calling `baseVault.batchDepositERC20`, `baseVault.batchDepositERC721`, and `baseVault.batchDepositERC1155` as shown below:

    baseVault.batchDepositERC20(alice.addr, vault, [XYZ.addr], [50])
    baseVault.batchDepositERC721(alice.addr, vault, [APE.addr], [#1])
    baseVault.batchDepositERC1155(alice.addr, vault, [ABC.addr], [#1], [50], "")

An attacker notices that there is residual allowance left on the `baseVault`, thus the attacker executes the following transactions to steal Alice’s assets and send them to the attacker’s wallet address.

    baseVault.batchDepositERC20(alice.addr, attacker.addr, [XYZ.addr], [950])
    baseVault.batchDepositERC721(alice.addr, attacker.addr, [APE.addr, APE.addr], [#2, #3])
    baseVault.batchDepositERC1155(alice.addr, attacker.addr, [ABC.addr], [#1], [950], "")

One can drain eth out from migration module to buyout module using custom made FERC1155 token.

The proof of concept shows a scenario where Alice is draining migration module using custom made FERC1155 token.

1.  Setup: other people are using migration module and they deposited some eth. (using Alice and Bob just to simplify the set up process)
2.  Alice prepared the custom FERC1155 (let’s say `evil_token`)
3.  Alice create a vault with the `evil_token`
4.  Alice proposes and joins with 0.5 ether
5.  When Alice calls `commit`, the `evil_token` will reenter `commit` and send money to buyout module

Note: For simplicity, the `evil_token` reenters for a fixed number of times. But one can adjust to drain all the eth in the migration module. Note2: For now the eth is in the buyout module, but given the current implementation of `buyout` module, the same actor can drain eth from buyout.

The `commit` function is not written in Checks, Effects, Interactions (CEI) patterns.

    // modules/Migration.sol::commit
    // proposal.isCommited and started are set after the out going calls (i.e. start, setApprovalFor)
    // Mitigation idea: set the values before the out going calls
    
    206         if (currentPrice > proposal.targetPrice) {
    207             // Sets token approval to the buyout contract
    208             IFERC1155(token).setApprovalFor(address(buyout), id, true);
    209             // Starts the buyout process
    210             IBuyout(buyout).start{value: proposal.totalEth}(_vault);
    211             proposal.isCommited = true;
    212             started = true;

Funds in migration proposals could potentially be stuck forever if a buyout auction on the same vault is started by other party.

Most of the functions within `Migration.sol` can only be executed depending on the state of buyout auction in `Buyout.sol`. When there is no buyout happening, a migration proposal can be made and anyone can contribute to the proposal. However, it is possible that a buyout auction is started by another party while a pending proposal is not commited yet.

When this scenario happens, there is no action that could be taken to interact with the pending proposal. All funds that have been contributed cannot be withdrawn. This is because the functions only check for the state of the buyout auction, instead of also considering whether the buyout auction’s proposer is `Migration.sol`:

    (address token, uint256 id) = IVaultRegistry(registry).vaultToToken(_vault);
    if (id == 0) revert NotVault(_vault);
    // Reverts if buyout state is not inactive
    (, , State current, , , ) = IBuyout(buyout).buyoutInfo(_vault);
    State required = State.INACTIVE;
    if (current != required) revert IBuyout.InvalidState(required, current);

Proposal contributors have to wait until the buyout failed before they can withdraw their funds. In case the buyout succeeded, their funds will be stuck forever.

### [](#proof-of-concept-13)Proof of Concept

*   Bob made a migration proposal and contributed `0.5 eth`.
*   Alice individually started a buyout auction. Buyout state is now `ACTIVE`.
*   Bob can’t leave the proposal.
*   Alice successfully ended the buyout auction. Buyout state is now `SUCCESS`.

### [](#recommended-mitigation-steps-13)Recommended Mitigation Steps

Modify the checks for the following functions:

*   `leave`
*   `withdrawContribution`

So users can withdraw their funds from the proposal when the buyout auction proposer is not `Migration.sol`.

In addition, it’s also possible that there are multiple ongoing proposals on the same vault and the buyout is started by one of them. To allow other proposals’ contributors to withdraw their fund, consider tracking the latest `proposalId` that started the buyout on a vault:

    mapping(address => uint256) public latestCommit;
    
    function commit(address _vault, uint256 _proposalId) {
        ...
        if (currentPrice > proposal.targetPrice) {
            ...
            latestCommit[_vault] = _proposalId;
        }
    }

For `leave`:

    (, address proposer, State current, , , ) = IBuyout(buyout).buyoutInfo(_vault);
    
    // if buyout is started by this proposal, check that state is inactive. Else allow leaving.
    if (proposer == address(this) && latestCommit[_vault] == _proposalId) {
        State required = State.INACTIVE;
        if (current != required) revert IBuyout.InvalidState(required, current);
    }

For `withdrawContribution`:

    (, address proposer, State current, , , ) = IBuyout(buyout).buyoutInfo(_vault);
    
    // if buyout is started by this proposal, check that state is inactive. Else allow withdrawing.
    if (proposer == address(this) && latestCommit[_vault] == _proposalId) {
        State required = State.INACTIVE;
        if (current != required) revert IBuyout.InvalidState(required, current);
    }
    if (
        migrationInfo[_vault][_proposalId].newVault != address(0)
    ) revert NoContributionToWithdraw();

Failed proposal can be committed again and eth stolen from migration contract in combination with other vulnerabilities submitted.

### [](#proof-of-concept-14)Proof of Concept

[https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-07-fractional/blob/8f2697ae727c60c93ea47276f8fa128369abfe51/src/modules/Migration.sol#L194](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-07-fractional/blob/8f2697ae727c60c93ea47276f8fa128369abfe51/src/modules/Migration.sol#L194)

Commit can be called as long as it has been less than 7 days from the start time. The buyout period is specified as 4 days in the buyout contract. This means that as long as proposal is committed within 3 days of starting, commit can be called again after a failed buyout (4 days) because the current time will still be less than 7 days from the start time.

This can be used in combination with a vulnerability I previously reported. The contract does not account for the actual number of fractions that it receives back from a failed buyout. If it sent 10 fractions and 3 eth to a buyout it may receive back 15 fractions and 2 eth due to trading against the buyout. Because commit can called again on the same proposal, the second time it will try to send the fraction balance of the contract, now 15, and the value of the eth in the proposal, 3 eth. This transaction will either revert due to not having enough eth or it will send 3 eth pulling from eth deposited to other migration proposals.

This could be exploited by creating a vault and immediately migrating it. Once the migration starts the user could sell fractions to themselves and get eth, making sure to keep the number of fractions under 51%, to prevent a successful buyout. After the buyout fails they can then call the commit function again and more eth will be sent. They can then sell fractions to themselves netting more eth than they initially supplied. This could be done repeatedly until all eth has been stolen from the migration contract.

### [](#recommended-mitigation-steps-14)Recommended Mitigation Steps

Change the length of either the migration period or the buyout period to match so that a proposal can’t be replayed.

The `migrateFractions` function in the `Migration.sol` contract is used to send new vault tokens to the user calculated based on the amount of ETH and fractions the user contributed to the migration proposal. After it is called once the user should have all the new vault tokens owed to them.

Since the function does not check if the user had already called it, a user may call it more than once, allowing them to gain more new vault tokens than they are owed. If a user repeatedly uses this function to gain new tokens then other users may not be able to get their new tokens.

### [](#proof-of-concept-15)Proof of Concept

Test code added to `Migrations.t.sol`:

The test code below shows the first user (Alice) migrating their tokens to the new vault twice before the second user (Bob) calls `migrateFractions` which then fails.

If one proposal starts a buyout which fails, and then another proposal starts a buyout which succeeds, then both of them will be commited and `settleVault` can be called on any of them. If it’s called on the failed proposal first, then it will settle even though buyout has failed (and it can proceed to withdraw all tokens to a new vault).

Malicious proposal being able to successfully migrate scenario:

1.  Bob starts a malicious proposal to migrate with a low `targetPrice`, which immediately initiates a buyout
2.  Buyout fails (but malicious proposal is marked as `committed`)
3.  Alice starts a good proposal to migrate, which goes on to buyout which eventually succeeds to get `50%+ fractions`
4.  Alice ends the buyout
5.  Bob immediately calls `settleVault` with his malicious proposal
6.  Bob’s malicious proposal settles (and he can go on to withdraw all tokens from the vault into his malicious proposal effectively stealing assets from Alice).

### [](#proof-of-concept-16)Proof of Concept

Add this code to test/Migration.t.sol

    function testPanprogBugH3() public {
    	initializeMigration(alice, bob, 10000, 4000, true);
    
    	(nftReceiverSelectors, nftReceiverPlugins) = initializeNFTReceiver();

    	// Bob joins the proposal with 4000 fractions
    	bob.migrationModule.join{value: 1 ether}(vault, 1, 4000);

### [](#recommended-mitigation-steps-16)Recommended Mitigation Steps

Add a new storage variable for currently active proposal id. Allow calling `settleVault` only for active proposal id (and also only if buyout’s proposer equals `Migration` address, otherwise there can be a different successful buyout not connected to the active proposal). Also add appropriate checks with active proposal in the other functions as well (don’t allow to commit if there is an active proposal etc).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

_Submitted by PwnedNoMore, also found by Treasure-Seeker_

The `end` function in the `Buyout` contract uses `IERC1155(token).balanceOf(address(this), id)` to determine the amount of deposited fraction tokens without distinguishing whether those fraction tokens are depositied by the `sellFractions` function or by direct transferring. Note that only the `sellFractions` function is constrained by `PROPOSAL_PERIOD`.

This vulnerability lets a 51-holder gain the whole batch of NFTs without paying for the rest 49% fractions.

Assume a vault X creates 100 fraction tokens and the market-decided price of a fraction token is 1 ether (i.e., the ideal value of the locked NFTs in vault X is 100 ether). Let’s also assume that Alice holds 51 tokens (maybe by paying 51 ether on opensea).

Followings are two scenarios, where the benign one follows the normal workflow and the malicious one exploits the vulnerability.

#### [](#benign-scenario)Benign Scenario

*   Alice starts a buyout by depositing her 51 fraction tokens and 49 ether, making the `fractionPrice` 1 ether
*   Other users are satisfied with the provided price, and hence no one buys or sells their fraction tokens
*   The buyout succeeds:
    
    *   Alice gets the locked NFTs
    *   Other fraction holders can invoke `cash` to redeem their fraction tokens with a price of 1 ether
*   As a result, Alice paid 100 ether in total to get the locked NFTs.

#### [](#malicious-scenario)Malicious Scenario

*   Alice starts a buyout by depositing 0 fraction tokens and 1 wei, making the `fractionPrice` 0.01 wei.
    
    *   Note that Alice can create a separated account whose balance for the fraction token is 0, to start the buyout
*   No one is satisfied with the price (0.01 wei v/s 1 ether) and hence they will try to buy fraction tokens to reject the buyout
    
    *   Since there is not any fraction tokens locked in the `Buyout` contract from Alice, other users do not need to do anything
*   Alice invokes the `end` function
    
    *   But before invoking the `end` function, **Alice directly invokes `IERC1155(token).safeTransferFrom` to send the rest 51 fraction token to the `Buyout` contract**
    *   The `end` function will treat the buyout successful, since the `IERC1155(token).balanceOf(address(this), id)` is bigger than 50%
    *   The above two message calls happen in a single transaction, hence no one can front-run
*   As a result
    
    *   **Alice only paid 51 ether to get the locked NFTs whose value is 100 ether**
    *   **Other fraction holders get nothing (but they had paid for the fraction token before)**

In short, a malicious users can buy any NFT by just paying half of the NFT’s market price.

### [](#recommended-mitigation-steps-17)Recommended Mitigation Steps

For each buyout, add a new field to record the amount of fraction tokens deposited by `sellFractions`. And in the `end` function, use the newly-added field to determine whether the buyout can be processed or not.

### [](#impact-7)Impact

In `propose()` in Migration.sol, there is no check that the lengths of the `selectors` and `plugins` arrays are the same. This means that if a migration is successful, the `install()` function in Vault.sol could revert beacuse we access an array out of bounds. This prevents a new vault being created thereby permanently locking assets inside the vault.

### [](#proof-of-concept-17)Proof of Concept

1.  User starts a new migration proposal where `selectors.length != plugins.length`
2.  Enough users join proposal and the buyout bid starts
3.  Buyout bid is successful and migration starts with `settleVault()`
4.  A new vault is cloned with `create()` -> `registry.deployFor()` -> `vault.install(selectors, plugins)`
5.  a. If `selectors.length > plugins.length` then we get an out of bounds error and transaction reverts  
    b. If `selectors.length < plugins.length` then the excess values in `plugins` is ignored which is tolerable
6.  In scenario a., the migration fails and a new migration cannot start so assets in the vault are permanently locked

This may seem quite circumstantial as this problem only occurs if a user specifies `selectors` and `plugins` wrongly however it is very easy for an attacker to perform this maliciously with no cost on their behalf, it is highly unlikely that users will be able to spot a malicious migration.

Additionally, I would suggest adding such a check in the `install()` function as this may prevent similiar problems if new modules are added.

[](#h-20-migrations-leave-function-allows-leaving-a-committed-proposal)[\[H-20\] Migration’s `leave` function allows leaving a committed proposal](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-07-fractional-findings/issues/379)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

_Submitted by kenzo_

The `leave` function allows to leave a proposal even if the proposal has been committed and failed. This makes it a (probably unintended) duplicate functionality of `withdrawContributions`, which is the function that should be used to withdraw failed contributions.

### [](#impact-8)Impact

User assets might be lost: When withdrawing assets from a failed migration, users should get back a different amount of assets, according to the buyout auction result. (I detailed this in another issue - “Migration::withdrawContribution falsely assumes that user should get exactly his original contribution back”). But when withdrawing assets from a proposal that has not been committed, users should get back their original amount of assets, as that has not changed. Therefore, if `leave` does not check if the proposal has been committed, users could call `leave` instead of `withdrawContribution` and get back a different amounts of assets than they deserve, on the expense of other users.

### [](#proof-of-concept-18)Proof of Concept

The `leave` function [does not check](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-07-fractional/blob/main/src/modules/Migration.sol#L141) anywhere whether `proposal.isCommited == true`.

Therefore, if a user calls it after a proposal has been committed and failed, it will continue to send him his original contribution back, instead of sending him the adjusted amount that has been returned from Buyout.

### [](#recommended-mitigation-steps-19)Recommended Mitigation Steps

Revert in `leave` if `proposal.isCommited == true`. You might be also able to merge the functionality of `leave` and `withdrawContribution`, but that depends on how you will implement the fix for `withdrawContribution`.

### [](#impact-9)Impact

The `Vault#execute` function calls a target contract’s function via `delegatecall` if the caller is either the owner of the Vault or the target contract is part of a merkle tree, indicating a permission to call the target contract.

    // Check that the caller is either a module with permission to call or the owner.
    if (!MerkleProof.verify(_proof, merkleRoot, leaf)) {
        if (msg.sender != owner)
            revert NotAuthorized(msg.sender, _target, selector);
    }

_(See [Vault#execute](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-07-fractional/blob/main/src/Vault.sol#L62))_

If the checks succeed, the internal `_execute()` function is used to execute the call via `delegatecall`.

`delegatecall`s have to be used with caution because the contract being called is using the caller’s contract storage, i.e. the callee contract can alter the caller’s contract state (for more info, see [Solidity docs](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/introduction-to-smart-contracts.html?highlight=delegatecall#delegatecall-callcode-and-libraries)).

The developers seem to be aware of the danger that the callee contract is able to overtake the Vaults ownership, by changing the Vaults `owner` variable, as the `owner` is cached before the `delegatecall` and afterwards checked that the variable did not change:

    // ...
    address owner_ = owner;
    // ...
    (success, response) = _target.delegatecall{gas:stipend}(_data);
    if (owner_ != owner) revert OwnerChanged(owner_, owner);
    // ...

_(See [Vault#\_execute](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-07-fractional/blob/main/src/Vault.sol#L126))_

However, changing the `owner` variable is not the only way the callee contract is able to overtake the Vaults ownership. If the `nonce` variable is re-set to `0`, the Vault’s `init` function becomes callable again, granting ownership to the caller:

    function init() external {
        if (nonce != 0) revert Initialized(owner, msg.sender, nonce);
        nonce = 1;
        owner = msg.sender;
    }

_(See [Vault#init](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-07-fractional/blob/main/src/Vault.sol#L25))_

Note that other storage variables (i.e. `merkleRoot` and `methods`) could also be altered, but this would not lead to a loss in ownership, i.e. the project could re-set the variables.

Nevertheless, a contract trying, due to being malicious or faulty, to change the Vaults ownership first needs to be permissioned by the owner by adding it to the merkle tree. Otherwise, the contract can not be called.

Due to the fact that the `owner` variable check is included, meaning **the project rates operational management already as being error-prone**, and the high number of security issues in connection to faulty usage of `delegatecall`, the severity is rated as MEDIUM (HIGH impact with a LOW likelihood).

### [](#proof-of-concept-19)Proof of Concept

Add the following code to the `test/Vault.t.sol` file and run `forge test --match-test "testExecuteNoRevertIfReinitialized" -vvvv`.

If the test succeeds, the Vault got re-initialized due to a `delegatecall` altering the Vault’s `nonce` variable.

    // Inside contract VaultTest.
    function testExecuteNoRevertIfReinitialized() public {
        vaultProxy.init(); // address(this) is owner
        HackyTargetContract targetContract = new HackyTargetContract();
        bytes32[] memory proof = new bytes32[](1);
        bytes memory data = abi.encodeCall(
            targetContract.changeNonce,
            ()
        );
    
        // Note that the call does NOT revert.
        vaultProxy.execute(address(targetContract), data, proof);
    
        // Note that the Vault can now be re-initialized as the execute
        // call above set the Vault's nonce to zero.
        vm.prank(address(1));
        vaultProxy.init();
    
        assertEq(vaultProxy.owner(), address(1));
    }
    
    // Outside contract VaultTest.
    contract HackyTargetContract {
        address public gap_owner;
        bytes32 public gap_merkleRoot;
    
        uint256 public nonce;
    
        function changeNonce() public {
            nonce = 0;
        }
    }

### [](#recommended-mitigation-steps-20)Recommended Mitigation Steps

Check the `nonce` variable before and after the `delegatecall` inside the `_execute()` function as well, e.g.:

    address owner_ = owner;
    uint256 nonce_ = nonce;
    
    // Execute delegatecall
    
    if (owner_ != owner || nonce_ != nonce) {
        revert InvalidStateChange();
    }
    
    // ...

Each vault owner can manage freely the creation and deletion of plugins at any time if the vault was deployed by calling `VaultRegistry.createFor()`. An owner can simply overwrite a current plugin selector with a new address and change the implementation of that plugin at any time. This can be used to frontrun others and change the logic of a call before it is mined.

This strategy can also be used to bypass the need to uninstall a plugin by overwriting a currently installed one with a different implementation without needing to first remove the old plugin and then install the new one. This can be made just by installing a selector that collides with a previously installed plugin and change the address that is pointing that selector.

### [](#proof-of-concept-20)Proof of Concept

There are two scenarios both relying on the fact that plugins can be overwritten which may lead to confusion in one case and to a malicious call in the other one.

#### [](#case-a-deployment-with-many-clashing-selectors)Case A: Deployment with many clashing selectors

A user can deploy a vault owner and install more than one plugin which selectors are the same. This will make that the last plugin address of the array will be pointed as the implementation of that plugin and the other ones will be overwritten. The whole installation process will emit an event containing the same selectors but different addresses which may be deceiving. Users that are not aware on how mapping data can be overwritten can be deceived because of this process.

    function test_canDeployWithCollidingSelector() public {
        // Getting the colliding selectors that point to different implementations.
        bytes4 selectorOne = bytes4(keccak256(bytes("func_2093253501(bytes)")));
        bytes4 selectorTwo = bytes4(keccak256(bytes("transfer(address,uint256)")));
        
        bytes4[] memory collidingSelectors = new bytes4[](2);
        address[] memory nonCollidingPlugins = new address[](2);
    
        collidingSelectors[0] = selectorOne;
        nonCollidingPlugins[0] = address(0xdead1);
    
        collidingSelectors[1] = selectorTwo;
        nonCollidingPlugins[1] = address(0xdead2);
    
        // Deploying a vault
        vault = alice.registry.createFor(
            merkleRoot,
            alice.addr,
            nonCollidingPlugins,
            collidingSelectors
        );
        token = registry.fNFT();
        setUpFERC1155(alice, token);
    
        assertEq(IVault(vault).owner(), alice.addr);
        assertEq(fERC1155.controller(), address(this));
    
        // Both selectors point to the same address of implementation.
        assertEq(IVault(vault).methods(selectorOne), address(0xdead2));
        assertEq(IVault(vault).methods(selectorTwo), address(0xdead2));
    }

#### [](#case-b-frontrun-other-users-call)Case B: Frontrun other users call

A malicious vault owner can deploy a vault with a legit plugin that other users will call on a regular basis. The owner can develop a malicious plugin implementation, wait until there is a transaction that is targeting that plugin and frontrun it overwriting the plugin address by using the same selector. The new implementation can have unintended behavior for that user. If the owner is even more decided to continue doing this, he can backrun the transaction with another call setting the plugin address back to the legit implementation.

    function test_canOverwritePlugin() public {
            // Generating the colliding selectors
            bytes4 selectorOne = bytes4(keccak256(bytes("collate_propagate_storage(bytes16)")));
            bytes4 selectorTwo = bytes4(keccak256(bytes("burn(uint256)")));
            
            bytes4[] memory collidingSelectors = new bytes4[](1);
            address[] memory nonCollidingPlugins = new address[](1);
    
            collidingSelectors[0] = selectorOne;
            nonCollidingPlugins[0] = address(0xdead1);
    
            // Deploying a vault
            vault = alice.registry.createFor(
                merkleRoot,
                alice.addr,
                nonCollidingPlugins,
                collidingSelectors
            );
            token = registry.fNFT();
            setUpFERC1155(alice, token);
    
            assertEq(IVault(vault).owner(), alice.addr);
            assertEq(fERC1155.controller(), address(this));
    
            // Checking that the selector one was properly installed and that points to 0xdead1
            assertEq(IVault(vault).methods(selectorOne), address(0xdead1));
    
            // At any time the owner will be able to overwrite the plugin by clashing with the existing one.
            // this can be used to frontrun a call that targets selectorOne and modify its implementation.
            vm.startPrank(alice.addr);
            bytes4[] memory clashingSelector = new bytes4[](1);
            address[] memory newPluginAddress = new address[](1);
    
            clashingSelector[0] = selectorTwo; // The one declared before.
            newPluginAddress[0] = address(0xdead2);
    
            IVault(vault).install(clashingSelector, newPluginAddress);
            vm.stopPrank();
    
            // Checking that the selector was indeed overwritten and now is pointing to 0xdead2
            assertEq(IVault(vault).methods(selectorOne), address(0xdead2));
            assertEq(IVault(vault).methods(selectorTwo), address(0xdead2)); // Redundant assertion.
            
            vm.startPrank(alice.addr);
            // Also, there is no need to have a clashing function with other name.
            // It is just enough to use the same function name as before with a new address.
            clashingSelector[0] = selectorOne;
            newPluginAddress[0] = address(0xdead3);
    
            IVault(vault).install(clashingSelector, newPluginAddress);
            vm.stopPrank();
            assertEq(IVault(vault).methods(selectorOne), address(0xdead3));
            assertEq(IVault(vault).methods(selectorTwo), address(0xdead3));            
        }

### [](#recommended-mitigation-steps-21)Recommended Mitigation Steps

First of all, it is important to unify the criteria related on which are the entry points for a user to deploy a vault. Having different functions that lead to distinct access control roles within a deployed vault is potentially an issue (as shown before).

Also, regarding plugin installation it is important to check if the plugin that is willing to be installed is not overwriting the `methods` mapping (in other words, checking if `methods(selector)` is empty in order to perform the installation) and if plugins are not intended to work as emergency functions that need to be injected into a vault quickly, I would consider timelocking the process of plugin installation.

### [](#impact-10)Impact

The secondary sales of a specific `FERC1155` token can be charged with a certain amount of fees established by the controller of the `FERC1155`. Those royalties are meant to be sent to a receiver according to the current implementation. Currently the protocol intends users to deploy vaults via `BaseVault.deployVault()` which further calls `VaultRegistry.create()` that uses the currently deployed `fNFT` instance which it is controlled by the protocol itself.

However, there is other path that allows users deploying a vault where they are also the controllers of the `fNFT` instance. This allows users to take control over how are the royalty fees changed. A user can easily change maliciously the amount of royalties (which are also uncapped) and steal a considerable (even the whole) amount of `FERC1155` transferred.

### [](#proof-of-concept-21)Proof of Concept

In order to illustrate this, we will conduct a hypothetical scenario where Alice is a malicious vault owner that deploys her vault by directly calling `VaultRegistry.createCollectionFor()`, bypassing the need to call `BaseVault.deployVault()`.

*   Alice creates a vault to fractionalize a pricy asset with the `_merkleRoot` containing the `Minter` module by calling `VaultRegistry.createCollectionFor()`. She is now owner of `Token`.
*   She mints an amount of `fTokens` and starts to distribute them among the community, and calls `Token.setRoyalties()` setting the royalties for the secondary market at 1% (in order to incentivize and grow a secondary market).
*   A few periods later once the secondary market of that token acquired considerable momentum, Alice scans the mempool and decides to frontrun Bob (who was performing a big transfer) and steals the 100% of payment.

As a result of this process, Bob transferred the token to the buyer and received no payment in exchange and Alice got her hands on the whole payment.

It is showcased on the following code that Alice has control over how the fees are modified and when.

        function test_CanFrontrunRoyalties() public {
            (vault, token) = alice.registry.createCollectionFor(
                merkleRoot,
                alice.addr,
                nftReceiverPlugins,
                nftReceiverSelectors
            );
    
            assertEq(IVault(vault).owner(), address(registry));
            assertEq(IFERC1155(token).controller(), alice.addr);
            
            // Supposing that Alice added herself a minter permission within the merkleRoot
            // that allows her to call Supply.mint(), she will be able to mint tokens.
    
            // A few days pass and now the tokens are distributed across the community.
            uint256 currentId = 1; // Supposed assigned tokenId.
            uint256 maxPercentage = 100;
            uint256 initialPercentage = 1;
    
            // Initially Alice sets royalties at 1% in order to incentive secondary market.
            vm.prank(alice.addr);
            IFERC1155(token).setRoyalties(currentId, alice.addr, initialPercentage);
    
            // Check that anyone but Alice can change the royalties.
            vm.startPrank(bob.addr);
            vm.expectRevert(
                abi.encodeWithSelector(
                    IFERC1155.InvalidSender.selector,
                    alice.addr, 
                    bob.addr
                )
            );    
            IFERC1155(token).setRoyalties(currentId, bob.addr, maxPercentage);

            uint256 salePriceInEther = 100 ether;

It is needed to define clearly how users are intended to deploy vaults under which privileges. The fact that a user can deploy a vault both from `BaseVault` and `VaultRegistry` having different privileges is an issue. If needed, the `VaultRegistry` key functions can be set as internal and have specific callers within `BaseVault` that control also the privileges of each creation in order to concentrate the vault creations within a single endpoint.

Also, it is extremely important to set a maximum cap for the royalties as soon as possible. Although this does not mitigate the fact that a malicious vault owner can frontrun others, it gives a maximum boundary. What will be a definitive solution is setting both a maximum cap for the royalties and timelock that function so that vault owners have to wait a certain amount of time before changing the royalties in order to bring predictability for the community.

MED - a hypothetical attack path with stated assumptions, but external requirements.

Attacker can create a vault with successful buyout status and non zero supply. The attacker can sell the fractions and then simply withdraw the assets.

### [](#proof-of-concept-23)Proof of Concept

*   [Proof of Concept](https://gist.github.com/zzzitron/24c02e069b428f7a95ebc6c931e29b4e#file-2022-07-fractionalv2-poc-modules-t-sol-L391-L414)

*   Deploy `evil_redeemer`: it will deployVault and calls redeem when the minted FERC1155 token is received
*   Calling `start` will start the process : `baseVault.deployVault`
*   The baseVault will deploy vault and eventually mint the FERC1155 token to the `evil_redeemer`
*   When the FERC1155 is received, the `evil_redeemer` calls `redeem` and set the state to `SUCCESS`
*   After the redeem, the tatalSupply of the FERC1155 is set.

Now, the attacker can send in some assets to the vault and sell the fractions. Then, the attacker can withdraw any asset at any time from the vault using the buyout module, because the state is already `SUCCESS`.

Note: An attacker can achieve the similar result with plugins. However, users might just refuse to buy tokens associated with such vaults and plugins. With the current issue, the user who is only looking at the vault will not notice this possibility unless they also check the status in the buyout module for the vault.

    // FERC1155.sol::mint
    // totalSupply is updated after _mint
    // _mint contains out going call if the `_to` address's codesize is non zero
    // Mitigation idea: update totalSupply before _mint
    
     79     function mint(
     80         address _to,
     81         uint256 _id,
     82         uint256 _amount,

### [](#impact-11)Impact

When `proposal.totalFractions` is equal to the total supply (meaning that all token holders want to participate in a migration), there is a division by zero in `_calculateTotal`.

In contrast to a buyout, where it does not make sense to initiate a buyout if all tokens are held (because there is a dedicated method for that), it does make sense to have a migration that all token holders join. Therefore, this case should be handled.

### [](#vulnerability-details-5)Vulnerability details

In the buyout module when a buyout starts - the module stores the `fractionPrice`, and when a user wants to buy/sell fractions the `fractionPrice` is loaded from storage and based on that the module determines the price of the fractions. The issue here is that the total supply might change between the time the buyout start till the buy/sell time, and the `fractionPrice` stored in the module might not represent the real price anymore.

Currently there are no module that mint/burn supply at the time of buyout, but considering that Fractional is an extendible platform - Fractional might add one or a user might create his own module and create a vault with it. An example of an innocent module that can change the total supply - a split module, this hypothetical module may allow splitting a coin (multiplying the balance of all users by some factor, based on a vote by the holders, the same way [QuickSwap did](https://twitter.com/quickswapdex/status/1506672432907620353) at March)). If that module is used in the middle of the buyout, that fraction price would still be based on the old supply.

### [](#impact-12)Impact

*   Buyout proposer can end up paying the entire buyout price, but ending up with only part of the vault.
*   Users may end up buying fractions for more than they’re really worth (if they’re unaware of the change in total supply).
*   Users may end up getting a lower price than intended while selling their fractions (in case of a burn).

### [](#proof-of-concept-25)Proof of Concept

Consider the following scenario

*   Alice creates a vault with a ‘split’ module
*   Bob starts a buyout for the price of 1 ETH
*   Alice runs the split modules twice (making the total supply 4 times the original supply) and then sells 25% of her fractions.
*   Bob lost his 1 ETH and got in exchange only 25% of the fractions.

Here’s a test (added to the `test/Buyout.t.sol` file) demonstrating this scenario (test passes = the bug exists).

        function testSplit_bug() public {
            initializeBuyout(alice, bob, TOTAL_SUPPLY, 0, true);
    
            // Bob proposes a buyout for 1 ether for the entire vault
            uint buyoutPrice = 1 ether;
            bob.buyoutModule.start{value: buyoutPrice}(vault);
    
            // simulate a x4 split
            // Alice is the only holder so we need to multiply only her balance x4
            bytes memory data = abi.encodeCall(
                Supply.mint,
                (alice.addr, TOTAL_SUPPLY * 3)
            );
            address supply = baseVault.supply();
            Vault(payable(vault)).execute(supply, data, new bytes32[](0));
    
            // Alice now sells only 1/4 of the total supply 
            // (TOTAL_SUPPLY is now 1/4 of the actual total supply)
            alice.buyoutModule.sellFractions(vault, TOTAL_SUPPLY);
    
            // Alice got 1 ETH and still holds 3/4 of the vault's fractions
            assertEq(getETHBalance(alice.addr), buyoutPrice + INITIAL_BALANCE);
            assertEq(getFractionBalance(alice.addr), TOTAL_SUPPLY * 3);
    
        }

Trying to create a proof for minting was too much time-consuming, so I just disabled the proof check in `Vault.execute` in order to simulate the split:

            // if (!MerkleProof.verify(_proof, merkleRoot, leaf)) {
            //     if (msg.sender != owner)
            //         revert NotAuthorized(msg.sender, _target, selector);
            // }

### [](#recommended-mitigation-steps-26)Recommended Mitigation Steps

Calculate fraction price at the time of buy/sell according to the current total supply: (Disclosure: this is based on a solution I made for a different bug).

*   This can still cause an issue if a user is unaware of the new fraction price, and will be selling his fractions for less than expected. Therefore, you’d might want to revert if the total supply has changed, while adding functionality to update the lastTotalSupply - this way there’s an event notifying about the fraction-price change before the user buys/sells.

### [](#impact-13)Impact

`Migration.join()` and `Migration.leave()` can still work after unsucessful migration. As I submitted with my high-risk finding “Migration.`withdrawContribution()` might work unexpectedly after unsuccessful migration.”, withdraw logic after unsuccessful migration is different from the initial `leave()` logic and the withdrawal logic would be messy if users call `join()` and `leave()` after unsuccessful migration.

### [](#proof-of-concept-26)Proof of Concept

According to the [explanation](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-07-fractional/blob/8f2697ae727c60c93ea47276f8fa128369abfe51/src/modules/Migration.sol#L23), join() and leave() functions must be called for 7 days before commition.

Currently, such a scenario is possible.

*   Alice creates a new migration and commits after some joins.
*   The migration ended unsuccessfully after 4 days.
*   Then users can call `leave()` or `withdrawContribution()` to withdraw their deposits but it wouldn’t work properly because we should recalculate eth/fractional amounts with returned amounts after unsuccessful migration.

### [](#tools-used-8)Tools Used

### [](#recommended-mitigation-steps-27)Recommended Mitigation Steps

We should add some restrictions to `join()` and `leave()` functions so that users can call these functions for 7 days before the migration is committed.

We should add these conditions to [join()](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-07-fractional/blob/8f2697ae727c60c93ea47276f8fa128369abfe51/src/modules/Migration.sol#L118) and [leave()](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-07-fractional/blob/8f2697ae727c60c93ea47276f8fa128369abfe51/src/modules/Migration.sol#L150).

Vault owners can install plugins via `Vault.install()`, with calls to the installed plugins made through the vault’s fallback function. Unlike the vault’s external `Vault.execute()` function, `fallback()` imposes no checks on the permissions of the caller, assuming proper installation of the plugin by the owner at install time.

While this design seems intentional given `NFTReceiver.sol`, it can lead to unintended vulnerabilities, like loss of vault NFTs, if the vault owner:

*   Mistakenly installs a plugin not intended for unpermissioned use or installs a malicious plugin
*   Is transferred vault ownership from a prior owner who misconfigured vault plugin installations

### [](#proof-of-concept-27)Proof of Concept

Example successful test similar to those from `Vault.t.sol` below.

The original vault owner installs a transfer target plugin, with selector `ERC721TransferFrom` on the vault. Ownership is then transferred to Bob, but the original owner uses the installed transfer plugin to steal the NFT deposited in the vault and send it to Alice (without Bob’s permission):

    function testFallbackWithTransferPlugin() public {
        bytes memory data = setUpExecute(alice);
    
        // install transfer from on vault
        address[] memory plugins = new address[](1);
        bytes4[] memory selectors = new bytes4[](1);
    
        plugins[0] = address(transferTarget);
        selectors[0] = transferTarget.ERC721TransferFrom.selector;
        vaultProxy.install(selectors, plugins);
    
        // set bob as the owner
        vaultProxy.transferOwnership(bob.addr);
    
        // check vault originally has the nft
        assertEq(IERC721(erc721).balanceOf(vault), 1);
        assertEq(IERC721(erc721).balanceOf(alice.addr), 0);
    
        // execute the nft transfer via plugin with fallback
        (bool success,) = address(vaultProxy).call(data);
    
        // check this contract transferred nft out of vault to alice
        // even after bob became owner
        assertEq(IERC721(erc721).balanceOf(vault), 0);
        assertEq(IERC721(erc721).balanceOf(alice.addr), 1);
    } 

### [](#recommended-mitigation-steps-28)Recommended Mitigation Steps

Consider tracking which installed plugins might require permissions alongside the `methods` mapping in storage. Potentially:

    /// @notice Mapping of function selector to plugin address
    mapping(bytes4 => address) public methods;
    
    /// @notice Mapping of plugin address to whether permissions required
    mapping(address => bool) public auths;

with `auths[plugin]` used in `fallback()`.

### [](#vulnerability-details-6)Vulnerability Details

As new total supply can be arbitrary, setting it significantly lower than current (say to 100 when it was 1e9 before) can be used to remove current minority shareholders, whose shares will end up being zero on a precision loss due to low new total supply value. This can go unnoticed as the effect is implementation based.

During Buyout the remaining shareholders are left with ETH funds based valuation and can sell the shares, but the minority shareholders that did contributed to the Migration, that could have other details favourable to them, may not realize that new shares will be calculated with the numerical truncation as a result of the new total supply introduction.

Setting the severity to Medium as this is a fund loss impact conditional on a user not understanding the particulars of the implementation.

### [](#proof-of-concept-28)Proof of Concept

Currently `migrateFractions()` calculates new shares to be transferred for a user as a fraction of her contribution:

[https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-07-fractional/blob/8f2697ae727c60c93ea47276f8fa128369abfe51/src/modules/Migration.sol#L469-L472](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-07-fractional/blob/8f2697ae727c60c93ea47276f8fa128369abfe51/src/modules/Migration.sol#L469-L472)

            // Calculates share amount of fractions for the new vault based on the new total supply
            uint256 newTotalSupply = IVaultRegistry(registry).totalSupply(newVault);
            uint256 shareAmount = (balanceContributedInEth * newTotalSupply) /
                totalInEth;

If Bob the msg.sender is a minority shareholder who contributed to Migration with say some technical enhancements of the Vault, not paying attention to the total supply reduction, his share can be lost on `commit()`:

[https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-07-fractional/blob/8f2697ae727c60c93ea47276f8fa128369abfe51/src/modules/Migration.sol#L209-L210](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-07-fractional/blob/8f2697ae727c60c93ea47276f8fa128369abfe51/src/modules/Migration.sol#L209-L210)

                // Starts the buyout process
                IBuyout(buyout).start{value: proposal.totalEth}(_vault);

As `commit()` starts the Buyout, Bob will not be able to withdraw as both `leave()` and `withdrawContribution()` require INACTIVE state:

[https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-07-fractional/blob/8f2697ae727c60c93ea47276f8fa128369abfe51/src/modules/Migration.sol#L149-L150](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-07-fractional/blob/8f2697ae727c60c93ea47276f8fa128369abfe51/src/modules/Migration.sol#L149-L150)

            State required = State.INACTIVE;
            if (current != required) revert IBuyout.InvalidState(required, current);

If Buyout be successful, Bob’s share can be calculated as zero given his small initial share and reduction in the Vault total shares.

For example, if Bob’s share together with the ETH funds he provided to Migration were cumulatively less than 1%, and new total supply is 100, he will lose all his contribution on `commit()` as `migrateFractions()` will send him nothing.

### [](#recommended-mitigation-steps-29)Recommended Mitigation Steps

Consider requiring that the new total supply should be greater than the old one:

[https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-07-fractional/blob/8f2697ae727c60c93ea47276f8fa128369abfe51/src/modules/Migration.sol#L95-L98](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-07-fractional/blob/8f2697ae727c60c93ea47276f8fa128369abfe51/src/modules/Migration.sol#L95-L98)

            proposal.oldFractionSupply = IVaultRegistry(registry).totalSupply(
                _vault
            );
            proposal.newFractionSupply = _newFractionSupply;
    +       require(proposal.newFractionSupply > proposal.oldFractionSupply, ""); // reference version

### [](#impact-14)Impact

The use of `payable.transfer()` is heavily frowned upon because it can lead to the locking of funds. The `transfer()` call requires that the recipient has a `payable` callback, only provides 2300 gas for its operation. This means the following cases can cause the transfer to fail:

*   The contract does not have a `payable` callback
*   The contract’s `payable` callback spends more than 2300 gas (which is only enough to emit something)
*   The contract is called through a proxy which itself uses up the 2300 gas

If a user falls into one of the above categories, they’ll be unable to receive funds from the vault in a migration wrapper. Inaccessible funds means loss of funds, which is Medium severity.

Both `leave()`:

While they both use `msg.sender`, the funds are tied to the address that deposited them (lines 159 and 321), and there is no mechanism to change the owner of the funds to an alternate address.

The underlying issue here is:

*   A user can create a buyout with as little as 1 wei (which is basically nothing, it’s worth about 1e-15 USD), without any fractions
*   Once a buyout is created, nobody else can create another buyout on the same vault till the previous buyout ends (even if he’d like to offer a much higher price)

This leads to the fact that with as little as 1 wei a user can block a vault from holding a buyout for 4 days.

### [](#impact-15)Impact

This can make the buyout module unavailable for a vault for days.

This can either be used in general, or to front-run and prevent a specific buyout offer.

        function testStartWith1Wei_bug() public {
            initializeBuyout(alice, bob, TOTAL_SUPPLY, 0, true);
    
            // bob holds zero fractions, and can still start a buyout
            assertEq(getFractionBalance(bob.addr), 0);
    
            // Bob starts a buyout with as little as 1 wei
            bob.buyoutModule.start{value:1}(vault);
    
            // almost 4 days have passed but Alice still
            // can't start a buyout till Bob's buyout ends
            vm.warp(block.timestamp + 3.9 days);
    
            // the next call would revert with the `invalid state` error
            vm.expectRevert(

            // Alice can't start a buyout till eve's buyout ends

*   While a buyout is running - allow other users to offer a higher buyout
    
    *   This can either be a continuation of the previous buyout, or start a new one with proposal/rejection period starting form the current time.
    *   In case it restarts the buyout - you’d might want to require a minimum increase from the previous buyout price (e.g. 5% more than the previous one), in order to prevent a buyout from running forever
*   Alternately, you can require a user to hold a minimum percent of fractions to start a buyout, this way if the offer is unrealistically low - the user would loose his fractions. Effectively putting a price tag for DoS-ing a vault.

[](#code-summary)Code Summary
-----------------------------

### [](#code-quality-and-test-coverage)Code Quality and Test Coverage

In summary, the code quality of the Fractional was found to be high. The codes were also found to be well-documented and the team took the efforts to document the NatSpec for all the functions within the contracts. As a result, it is easy for the reader to understand the overall architecture and design of the system. However, some minor errors within the comments were observed. Although it does not cause any technical issues or result in a loss of fund, it is recommended for the team to review them and update them accordingly to ensure that the documentation reflects what the system does accurately.

Further improvement to the code readability can be made by using a modifier, refer to the “Use modifier for better readability and code reuse” below. Another key concern that is the functions within the `Supply` and `Transfer` contracts are implemented entirely in assembly. Even though assembly code was used for gas optimization, it reduces the readability (and future updatability) of the code. Consider eliminating all assembly code and re-implement them in Solidity to make the code significantly more clean.

Test coverage was found to be high. All the key features were found to be covered in the test.

[](#key-risks--improvement-opportunities)Key Risks & Improvement Opportunities
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### [](#excessive-power-holds-by-vault-owner)Excessive Power Holds By Vault Owner

Fractional allows vault owners to install custom plugins to extend the functionality of the vault during or after deployment. The plugins within the vault could theoretically perform any task such as transferring the asset from the vault to an arbitrary wallet address or minting any amount of new fractional tokens. Therefore, it is critical for the fractional token holders of a vault to be aware of this risk and the token holders must ensure that the vault owner is trustworthy.

Under normal circumstances, the vault owner will be Fractional’s `VaultRegistry` contract, which does not pose much of an issue because `VaultRegistry` contract is considered a trusted entity within Fractional protocol. However, potential fractional token investors should take note that some vaults can be created via `VaultRegistry.createFor`, which will transfer the ownership of the vault to an arbitrary address. In such a case, potential investors must ensure that the new vault owner is trustworthy enough not to perform a rug pull or steal the assets in the vault.

Consider documenting this risk if needed so that potential fractional token holders can make an informed decision.

### [](#conflicting-module-might-block-functionality-of-another-module)Conflicting Module Might Block Functionality Of Another Module

Both the `Buyout` and `Migration` modules depend heavily on the state of the vault (e.g. INACTIVE, LIVE, SUCCESS) to determine if a function can be executed at any point in time. For instance, a buyout can only be started only if the vault state is “INACTIVE”, or a migration can only be settled if the vault state is “SUCCESS”.

A module changing the vault state might cause unintended behavior in another module. For instance, when a buyer starts an auction within the `Buyout` module, it will cause the vault state to change to `State.LIVE`. As a result, it will cause contributors of a proposal within the `Migration` module to be unable to withdraw their contributed assets from the proposal because the `Migration.withdrawContribution` function requires the vault state to be `State.INACTIVE`. Thus, contributor assets are stuck in the `Migration` contract whenever a buyer starts an auction in the `Buyout` module.

It is recommended to take extra caution when writing the module to ensure that it does not accidentally block the functionality of another module.

### [](#step-in-a-process-can-be-bypassed-or-triggered-in-an-out-of-order-manner)Step In A Process Can Be Bypassed Or Triggered In An Out-of-Order Manner

To ensure that the vault operates in an expected manner, it is important that the contracts prevent users from calling functions in an out-of-order manner or bypassing certain step in a process. It was observed that it is possible for users to call the function in an out-of-order manner or bypass certain step in a process entirely. Following illustrates some of the examples:

*   A user can call `Migration.settleVault` follow by `Migration.migrateFractions`, thus skipping the `Migration.settleFractions`
*   A contributor should call `Migration.leave` to leave a proposed migration to get back their asset if the proposal has not been committed yet. However, instead of calling `Migration.leave`, the contributor can choose to call `Migration.withdrawContribution` which will succeed without any revert.

Ensure that the sequence in a process (e.g. buyout or migration process) is strictly followed and enforced.

### [](#re-entrancy-risks)Re-entrancy Risks

The key features of the protocols were found to be following the “Checks Effects Interactions” pattern rigorously, which helps to prevent any possible re-entrancy attack. So far no re-entrancy attack that can lead to loss of asset was observed during the contest. However, further improvements can be made to guard against future re-entrancy attacks in case any attack vector is missed out by C4’s wardens during the contest.

A number of key functions within `Buyout` and `Migration` modules deal with ERC1155, which contains a hook that will make a callback to the recipient whenever a transfer occurs, thus increasing the risk of a re-entrancy attack. Refer to the “Lack Of Reentrancy Guards” issue for more details.

Thus, it would be prudent to implement additional reentrancy prevention wherever possible by utilizing the `nonReentrant` modifier from [Openzeppelin Library](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/security/ReentrancyGuard.sol) to block possible re-entrancy as a defense-in-depth measure.

### [](#input-validation)Input Validation

Although input validation has been already implemented in the majority of the functions, it can be further strengthened to thwart potential attacks or prevent unexpected behavior in the future. For instance, `Vault.transferOwnership` does not check if the ownership is being transferred to `address(0)`, which might affect the functionality of the vault.

[](#l-01-lack-of-reentrancy-guards)\[L-01\] Lack Of Reentrancy Guards
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Whenever `IERC1155(token).safeTransferFrom` is called, the `to` address can re-enter back to the contracts due to the `ERC1155TokenReceiver(to).onERC1155Received(msg.sender, from, id, amount, data)` code (hook)

[https://github.com/Rari-Capital/solmate/blob/03e425421b24c4f75e4a3209b019b367847b7708/src/tokens/ERC1155.sol#L55](https://github.com/Rari-Capital/solmate/blob/03e425421b24c4f75e4a3209b019b367847b7708/src/tokens/ERC1155.sol#L55)

    function safeTransferFrom(
        address from,
        address to,
        uint256 id,
        uint256 amount,
        bytes calldata data
    ) public virtual {
        require(msg.sender == from || isApprovedForAll[from][msg.sender], "NOT_AUTHORIZED");
    
        balanceOf[from][id] -= amount;
        balanceOf[to][id] += amount;
    
        emit TransferSingle(msg.sender, from, to, id, amount);
    
        require(
            to.code.length == 0
                ? to != address(0)
                : ERC1155TokenReceiver(to).onERC1155Received(msg.sender, from, id, amount, data) ==
                    ERC1155TokenReceiver.onERC1155Received.selector,
            "UNSAFE_RECIPIENT"
        );
    }

The following functions utilise `IERC1155(token).safeTransferFrom` that allows the caller or proposer to re-enter back to the contracts

*   [`Buyout.buyFractions`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-07-fractional/blob/8f2697ae727c60c93ea47276f8fa128369abfe51/src/modules/Buyout.sol#L149)

### [](#recommendation)Recommendation

Apply necessary reentrancy prevention by utilizing the OpenZeppelin’s nonReentrant modifier to block possible re-entrancy.

[](#l-02-migration-sequence-not-enforced)\[L-02\] Migration Sequence Not Enforced
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Functions should be called in the following sequence to migrate a vault after a successful buyout.

1.  `Migration.settleVault` - Create new vault
2.  `Migration.settleFractions` - Mint new fractional tokens to new vault
3.  `Migration.migrateFractions` - Give investors the new fractional token

However, a user can call `Migration.settleVault` follow by `Migration.migrateFractions`, thus skipping the `Migration.settleFractions`.

Although it does not result in any loss of asset, allowing users to call the functions pertaining to migration in an out-of-order manner might cause unintended consequence in the future.

### [](#recommendation-1)Recommendation

After the `Migration.settleFractions` has been executed, the `migrationInfo[_vault][_proposalId].fractionsMigrated` will be set to `true`.

[https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-07-fractional/blob/8f2697ae727c60c93ea47276f8fa128369abfe51/src/modules/Migration.sol#L257](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-07-fractional/blob/8f2697ae727c60c93ea47276f8fa128369abfe51/src/modules/Migration.sol#L257)

    ) external {
        ..SNIP..
        migrationInfo[_vault][_proposalId].fractionsMigrated = true;
    }

Within the `Migration.migrateFractions` function, check that `migrationInfo[_vault][_proposalId].fractionsMigrated == true` to ensure that the `Migration.settleFractions` has been executed.

    function migrateFractions(address _vault, uint256 _proposalId) external {
    +	// Fractional tokens must be minted first before migrating
    +	require(migrationInfo[_vault][_proposalId].fractionsMigrated, "Fractional token not minted yet");
        // Reverts if address is not a registered vault
        (, uint256 id) = IVaultRegistry(registry).vaultToToken(_vault);
        if (id == 0) revert NotVault(_vault);
        // Reverts if buyout state is not successful
        (, address proposer, State current, , , ) = IBuyout(buyout).buyoutInfo(
            _vault
        );
        State required = State.SUCCESS;
        if (current != required) revert IBuyout.InvalidState(required, current);
        // Reverts if proposer of buyout is not this contract
        if (proposer != address(this)) revert NotProposalBuyout();

[](#l-03-risk-of-plugins)\[L-03\] Risk of Plugins
-------------------------------------------------

All plugins’ functions within the vault can be called by any public user. If the plugins contain any unprotected privileged functions, it can be called by malicious user.

[https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-07-fractional/blob/8f2697ae727c60c93ea47276f8fa128369abfe51/src/Vault.sol#L38](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-07-fractional/blob/8f2697ae727c60c93ea47276f8fa128369abfe51/src/Vault.sol#L38)

    }

### [](#recommendation-2)Recommendation

Include a warning in the comments or documentation so that the vault owner is aware that any plugin’s function added can be called by the public users. Vault owners should ensure that plugin’s functions have the necessary access control in place so that only authorised users can trigger the functions.

[](#l-07-consider-two-phase-ownership-transfer)\[L-07\] Consider Two-Phase Ownership Transfer
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### [](#description-1)Description

Owner can calls `Vault.transferOwnership` function to transfers the ownership to the new address directly. As such, there is a risk that the ownership is transferred to an invalid address, thus causing the contract to be without a owner.

[https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-07-fractional/blob/8f2697ae727c60c93ea47276f8fa128369abfe51/src/Vault.sol#L93](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-07-fractional/blob/8f2697ae727c60c93ea47276f8fa128369abfe51/src/Vault.sol#L93)

    /// @notice Transfers ownership to given account
    /// @param _newOwner Address of new owner
    function transferOwnership(address _newOwner) external {
        if (owner != msg.sender) revert NotOwner(owner, msg.sender);
        owner = _newOwner;
        emit TransferOwnership(msg.sender, _newOwner);
    }

Controller can calls `ERC1155.transferController` function to transfers the controller role to the new address directly. As such, there is a risk that the ownership is transferred to an invalid address, thus causing the contract to be without a controller.

[https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-07-fractional/blob/8f2697ae727c60c93ea47276f8fa128369abfe51/src/FERC1155.sol#L229](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-07-fractional/blob/8f2697ae727c60c93ea47276f8fa128369abfe51/src/FERC1155.sol#L229)

    /// @notice Updates the controller address for the FERC1155 token contract
    /// @param _newController Address of new controlling entity
    function transferController(address _newController)
        external
        onlyController
    {
        if (_newController == address(0)) revert ZeroAddress();
        _controller = _newController;
        emit ControllerTransferred(_newController);
    }

### [](#recommendation-6)Recommendation

Consider implementing a two step process where the owner or controller nominates an account and the nominated account needs to call an `acceptOwnership()` function for the transfer of admin to fully succeed. This ensures the nominated EOA account is a valid and active account.

[](#l-08-migration-proposer-can-hijack-other-users-buyout-to-settle-a-vault)\[L-08\] Migration Proposer Can Hijack Other User’s Buyout To Settle A Vault
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

`Migration.settleVault` function should only be callable if the buyout initiated by the migration proposal is successful. However, it was observed that it is possible to call `Migration.settleVault` successfully even though the buyout initiated by the migration proposal has failed.

The following aims to demonstrate the issue:

1.  Alice (attacker) creates a migration proposal by calling `Migration.propose` function. Then, she calls `Migration.commit` to kick off the buyout process for the migration, and Alice’s proposal’s `isCommited` is set to `true`.
2.  Alice’s buyout is unsuccessful. At this point in time, note that Alice’s proposal’s `isCommited` still remains as `true`, and the vault state reverts back to `State.INACTIVE`.
3.  In order for the `Migration.settleVault` function to run successfully, the following three (3) requirements must be met:
    
    *   1st requirement - Proposal must be committed
    *   2nd requirement - Vault state must be set to `status.SUCCESS`
    *   3rd requirement - `proposal.newVault` must not be initialised, which means that new vault has not been deployed yet
4.  If Alice attempts to call `Migration.settleVault` function, it will revert because the vault state is not set to `State.SUCCESS` due to the failed buyout. In summary, her migration proposal meets all the requirements except for the 2nd requirement.
5.  Bob decides to buy out the NFTs in the vault, therefore, he calls the `Buyout.start` to kick start the auction. After the buyout period (4 days), the vault pool has more than 51% of the total supply, thus the buyout is successful.
6.  Bob proceeds to call the `Buyout.end` to end the auction. Since the buyout is successful, the vault state is set to `State.SUCCESS` now.
7.  Alice decided to hijack Bob’s buyout. Therefore, immediately after Bob called the `Buyout.end` function, Alice calls the `Migration.settleVault` function.
8.  Alice’s `Migration.settleVault` function call will succeed this time because the vault state has been set to `status.SUCCESS`.

This attack does not lead to loss of asset. Thus, I’m marking this as “Low”. Even though the migration proposal has settled the vault successfully, when Alice calls `Migration.migrateVaultERC[20|721|1155]`, it will revert because the `Buyout.withdrawERC[20|721|1155]` will detect that the caller (`Migration` module) is not the actual auction winner.

However, `Migration.settleVault` function could still be called successfully in a situation where it should be failing, thus it is something to be raised.

### [](#recommendation-7)Recommendation

Ensure that the `Migration.settleVault` can only be called if the buyout initiated by the migration proposal (within `Migration.commit`) has succeeded.

### [](#vulnerability-details-7)Vulnerability Details

The `Vault.install` function sets the 4 bytes function selector as the index of the `methods` mapping.

If there are two plugins with the same function name and parameter types, the second plugin will overwrite the first plugin.

[https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-07-fractional/blob/8f2697ae727c60c93ea47276f8fa128369abfe51/src/Vault.sol#L73](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-07-fractional/blob/8f2697ae727c60c93ea47276f8fa128369abfe51/src/Vault.sol#L73)

    /// @param _plugins Addresses of plugin contracts
    function install(bytes4[] memory _selectors, address[] memory _plugins)
        external
    {
        if (owner != msg.sender) revert NotOwner(owner, msg.sender);
        uint256 length = _selectors.length;
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < length; i++) {
            methods[_selectors[i]] = _plugins[i];
        }
        emit InstallPlugin(_selectors, _plugins);
    }

### [](#proof-of-concept-31)Proof-of-Concept

Assume that the following two plugins and their function need to be installed:

*   Contract = `ABC`, function = `transfer(address,uint256)`, function selector = `a9059cbb`
*   Contract = `XYZ`, function = `transfer(address,uint256)`, function selector = `a9059cbb`

Therefore, `_selectors` array will be `[a9059cbb, a9059cbb]`, and `_plugins` array will be `[ABC, XYZ]`.

Passing the above `_selectors` and `_plugins` arrays into the `Vault.install` function will cause the `ABC.transfer(address,uint256)` function to be overwritten by `XYZ.transfer(address,uint256)`.

When calling `methods[a9059cbb]`, it will only return the second plugin which is `XYZ` contract. Thus, `ABC.transfer(address,uint256)` will not be callable within the vault.

### [](#impact-16)Impact

This might potentially cause the asset to be stuck in the vault or cause key functionalities within the vault to be unusable due to missing plugin functions.

### [](#recommended-mitigation-steps-32)Recommended Mitigation Steps

It is recommended to revert the `Vault.install` transaction if the callers attempt to install two plugins with the same function selector so that they are aware of this “overwriting” issue. Additional comments can be added to warn the caller about this issue or inform the caller that all function selectors must be unique across all plugins.

Consider implementing the following validation check so that plugin’s function will not be accidentally overwritten.

    function install(bytes4[] memory _selectors, address[] memory _plugins)
        external
    {
        if (owner != msg.sender) revert NotOwner(owner, msg.sender);
        uint256 length = _selectors.length;
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < length; i++) {
    +    	// If the selector has already been set, revert to prevent existing plugin's function to be overwritten
    +    	if (methods[_selectors[i]] != 0) revert SelectorCannotBeOverwritten();
            methods[_selectors[i]] = _plugins[i];
        }
        emit InstallPlugin(_selectors, _plugins);
    }

### [](#proof-of-concept-32)Proof of Concept

Per the code of `Buyout.end` function, the buyout is successful if the vault holds more than 50% of the fractional tokens.

[https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-07-fractional/blob/8f2697ae727c60c93ea47276f8fa128369abfe51/src/modules/Buyout.sol#L207](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-07-fractional/blob/8f2697ae727c60c93ea47276f8fa128369abfe51/src/modules/Buyout.sol#L207)

    function end(address _vault, bytes32[] calldata _burnProof) external {
        ..SNIP..
        // Reverts if current time is less than or equal to end time of auction
        uint256 endTime = startTime + REJECTION_PERIOD;
        if (block.timestamp <= endTime)
            revert TimeNotElapsed(block.timestamp, endTime);
    
        uint256 tokenBalance = IERC1155(token).balanceOf(address(this), id);
        // Checks totalSupply of auction pool to determine if buyout is successful or not
        if (
            (tokenBalance * 1000) /
                IVaultRegistry(registry).totalSupply(_vault) >
            500
        ) {
        ..SNIP..
    }

However, a large shareholder who owns 51% of the fractional tokens can send all his tokens to `address(0)`, which effectively burns 51% of the fraction tokens.

In this case, the NFT held within the vault is locked forever. There is no way to retrieve the NFT because it is impossible for a buyout to be successful as the vault can never hold more than 50% percent of the fractional tokens even if all the existing fractional token holders sell their tokens to the vault since 51% of them have already been sent to `address(0)`.

### [](#impact-17)Impact

The NFT and its fractional tokens lose their utility entirely when this event happens. For example, for a fractional token, no one would be able to display it in galleries in the metaverse. Additionally, fractional tokens of a locked NFT will be deemed as worthless in the open market.

### [](#recommended-mitigation-steps-33)Recommended Mitigation Steps

Consider an alternative buyout mechanism that is less reliant on the number of tokens being held by the vault to determine whether a buyout is successful or not.

### [](#vulnerability-details-8)Vulnerability Details

The vault creation only supports up to six (6) hashed permissions within a vault.

The following shows that the number of hashed permission (or leaf nodes) is hardcoded to six (6). The `new bytes32[](6);` code initialises the `hashes` array with 6 empty items within the `baseVault.generateMerkleTree` function.

Thus, if there are more than six (6) permissions, the `hashes` array will overflow and the transaction will revert.

                }
            }
        }
    }

Assume that Alice calls the `baseVault.deployVault` with the following module settings:

*   Module A - 5 functions (or 5 leaf nodes)
*   Module B - 1 function (or 1 leaf nodes)
*   Module C - 3 functions (or 3 leaf nodes)

Thus, the actual call will be as follows:

    baseVault.deployVault(1000, [Module A, Module B, Module C], [], [], mintProof)

When Alice calls `baseVault.deployVault` with the above three (3) modules, the `hashes` array will overflow and the transaction will revert.

The comment mentioned that the `FERC1155.royaltyInfo` function is to set the token royalties. However, the actual implementation is to read the token royalties.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To improve readability and code reuse, a `onlyOwner` modifer can be defined instead of performing a manual conditional check `if (owner != msg.sender) revert NotOwner(owner, msg.sender);` within the following affected functions:

*   [`Vault.setMerkleRoot`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-07-fractional/blob/8f2697ae727c60c93ea47276f8fa128369abfe51/src/Vault.sol#L86)

### [](#recommendation-11)Recommendation

It is recommended to define a modifier for access control and use it consistently throughout the codebase.

Following illustrates an example of the changes made to `Vault.setMerkleRoot` function.

Even though assembly code was used for gas optimization, it reduces the readability (and future updatability) of the code.

### [](#recommendation-12)Recommendation

Consider eliminating all assembly code and re-implement them in Solidity to make the code significantly more clean.

[](#g-03-caching-storage-variables-in-local-variables-to-save-gas)\[G-03\] Caching storage variables in local variables to save gas
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Anytime you are reading from storage more than once, it is cheaper in gas cost to cache the variable: a SLOAD cost 100gas, while MLOAD and MSTORE cost 3 gas.

In particular, in `for` loops, when using the length of a storage array as the condition being checked after each loop, caching the array length can yield significant gas savings if the array length is high

If a reference type function parameter is read-only, it is cheaper in gas to use calldata instead of memory.

Calldata is a non-modifiable, non-persistent area where function arguments are stored, and behaves mostly like memory,but it alleviates the compiler from the `abi.decode()` step that copies each index of the calldata to the memory index, each iteration costing `60` gas.

---------------------------------------------

Custom errors from Solidity 0.8.4 are cheaper than revert strings (cheaper deployment cost and runtime cost when the revert condition is met) while providing the same amount of information, as explained [here](https://blog.soliditylang.org/2021/04/21/custom-errors/)

Custom errors are defined using the error statement

[](#g-21-transfers-should-be-avoided-if-amount-null)\[G-21\] Transfers should be avoided if amount null
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Gas can be saved by avoid `ERC20.transfer` function calls when the `amount` to be transferred is `0`

### [](#proof-of-concept-53)Proof of Concept

Instances include:

##### [](#srcmodulesbuyoutsol-7)src/modules/Buyout.sol

    129:         IERC1155(token).safeTransferFrom(
    130:             msg.sender,
    131:             address(this),
    132:             id,
    133:             _amount,
    134:             ""
    135:         );

There is no check that `_amount` is not zero ( it is a function argument)

    141:         _sendEthOrWeth(msg.sender, ethAmount);

In the case `_amount` was zero, `ethAmount` would be zero too

### [](#recommended-mitigation-steps-55)Recommended Mitigation Steps

Add checks to ensure the `_amount` is not `0`.

[](#g-22-unchecked-arithmetic)\[G-22\] Unchecked arithmetic
-----------------------------------------------------------

The default “checked” behavior costs more gas when adding/diving/multiplying, because under-the-hood those checks are implemented as a series of opcodes that, prior to performing the actual arithmetic, check for under/overflow and revert if it is detected.

If it can statically be determined there is no possible way for your arithmetic to under/overflow (such as a condition in an if statement), surrounding the arithmetic in an `unchecked` block will save gas.

### [](#proof-of-concept-54)Proof of Concept

Instances:

##### [](#srcvaultsol-6)src/Vault.sol

`i` is cannot overflow as it is a `for` loop

    78:         for (uint256 i = 0; i < length; i++)

`i` is cannot overflow as it is a `for` loop

    104:         for (uint256 i = 0; i < length; i++)

### [](#recommended-mitigation-steps-56)Recommended Mitigation Steps

Place the arithmetic operations in an `unchecked` block.

[](#g-23--unnecessary-computation)\[G-23\] Unnecessary computation

Redundant external calls waste gas.
