[](#about-c4)About C4
---------------------

Code4rena (C4) is an open organization consisting of security researchers, auditors, developers, and individuals with domain expertise in smart contracts.

A C4 audit contest is an event in which community participants, referred to as Wardens, review, audit, or analyze smart contract logic in exchange for a bounty provided by sponsoring projects.

During the audit contest outlined in this document, C4 conducted an analysis of the Yieldy smart contract system written in Solidity. The audit contest took place between June 21—June 26, 2022.

This contest was judged by the Float Capital team: [moose-code](https://github.com/moose-code), [JasoonS](https://github.com/JasoonS) & [denhampreen](https://github.com/denhampreen).

Final report assembled by [itsmetechjay](https://twitter.com/itsmetechjay).

[](#summary)Summary
===================

The C4 analysis yielded an aggregated total of 31 unique vulnerabilities. Of these vulnerabilities, 4 received a risk rating in the category of HIGH severity and 27 received a risk rating in the category of MEDIUM severity.

Additionally, C4 analysis included 70 reports detailing issues with a risk rating of LOW severity or non-critical. There were also 70 reports recommending gas optimizations.

All of the issues presented here are linked back to their original finding.

[](#scope)Scope
===============

The code under review can be found within the [C4 Yieldy contest repository](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-yieldy), and is composed of 5 smart contracts written in the Solidity programming language and includes 892 lines of Solidity code.

[](#severity-criteria)Severity Criteria
=======================================

C4 assesses the severity of disclosed vulnerabilities according to a methodology based on [OWASP standards](https://owasp.org/www-community/OWASP_Risk_Rating_Methodology).

Vulnerabilities are divided into three primary risk categories: high, medium, and low/non-critical.

High-level considerations for vulnerabilities span the following key areas when conducting assessments:

*   Malicious Input Handling
*   Escalation of privileges
*   Arithmetic
*   Gas use

Further information regarding the severity criteria referenced throughout the submission review process, please refer to the documentation provided on [the C4 website](https://code4rena.com).

[](#h-01-no-withdrawal-possible-for-eth-toke-pool)[\[H-01\] No withdrawal possible for ETH TOKE pool](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-yieldy-findings/issues/87)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

_Submitted by Lambda_

The `withdraw` function of the ETH Tokemak pool has an additional parameter `asEth`. This can be seen in the Tokemak [Github repository](https://github.com/Tokemak/tokemak-smart-contracts-public/blob/2f54689d5d16ddfd1751493b161a049d6c98c382/contracts/pools/EthPool.sol#L94) or also when looking at the deployed code of the [ETH pool](https://etherscan.io/address/0xb104A7fA1041168556218DDb40Fe2516F88246d5#code). Compare that to e.g. the [USDC pool](https://etherscan.io/address/0xca5e07804beef19b6e71b9db18327d215cd58d4e#code), which does not have this parameter.

This means that the call to `withdraw` will when the staking token is ETH / WETH and no withdrawals would be possible.

### [](#proof-of-concept)Proof of Concept

A new `Staking` contract with ETH / WETH as the staking token is deployed. Deposits in Tokemak work fine, so users stake their tokens. However, because of the previously described issue, no withdrawal is possible, leaving the funds locked.

### [](#recommended-mitigation-steps)Recommended Mitigation Steps

Handle the case where the underlying asset is WETH / ETH separately and pass this boolean in that case.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    if (warmUpPeriod == 0) {
        IYieldy(YIELDY_TOKEN).mint(_recipient, _amount);
    } else {
        // create a claim and mint tokens so a user can claim them once warm up has passed
        warmUpInfo[_recipient] = Claim({
            amount: info.amount + _amount,
            credits: info.credits +
                IYieldy(YIELDY_TOKEN).creditsForTokenBalance(_amount),
            expiry: epoch.number + warmUpPeriod
        });
    
        IYieldy(YIELDY_TOKEN).mint(address(this), _amount);
    }

`Staking.sol#stake()` is a public function and you can specify an arbitrary address as the `_recipient`.

When `warmUpPeriod > 0`, with as little as 1 wei of `YIELDY_TOKEN`, the `_recipient`’s `warmUpInfo` will be push back til `epoch.number + warmUpPeriod`.

### [](#recommended-mitigation-steps-1)Recommended Mitigation Steps

Consider changing to not allow deposit to another address when `warmUpPeriod > 0`.

### [](#impact)Impact

The `BatchRequests.removeAddress` logic is wrong and it will produce a denial of service.

### [](#proof-of-concept-1)Proof of Concept

Removing the element from the array is done using the `delete` statement, but this is not the proper way to remove an entry from an array, it will just set that position to `address(0)`.

Append dummy data:

*   `addAddress('0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000001')`
*   `addAddress('0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000002')`
*   `addAddress('0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000003')`
*   `getAddresses()` => `address[]: 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000001,0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000002,0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000003`

Remove address:

*   `removeAddress(0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000002)` (or `0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000003`)
*   `getAddresses()` => `address[]: 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000001,0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000,0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000003`

Service is denied because it will try to call `canBatchContracts` to `address(0)`.

### [](#impact-1)Impact

Using sandwich attacks and JIT (Just-in-time liquidity), the yield of `LiquidityReserve` could be extracted for liquidity providers.

### [](#proof-of-concept-2)Proof of Concept

The yield of `LiquidityReserve` is distributed when a user calls `instantUnstakeReserve()` in `Staking`. Then, in `instantUnstake`, `totalLockedValue` increases with the fee paid by the user withdrawing. The fee is shared between all liquidity providers as they all see the value of their shares increase.

Therefore, an attacker could do the following sandwich attack when spotting a call to `instantUnstakeReserve()`.

*   In a first tx before the user call, borrow a lot of `stakingToken` and `addLiquidity`
*   The user call to `instantUnstakeReserve()` leading to a fee of say`x\`
*   In a second tx after the user call, `removeLiquidity` and repay the loan, taking a large proportion of the user fee

The problem here is that you can instantly add and remove liquidity without penalty, and that the yield is instantly distributed.

### [](#recommended-mitigation-steps-3)Recommended Mitigation Steps

To mitigate this, you can

*   store the earned fees and distribute them across multiple blocks to make sure the attack wouldn’t be worth it
*   add a small fee when removing liquidity, which would make the attack unprofitable
*   prevent users from withdrawing before X blocks or add a locking mechanism

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

_Submitted by 0x1f8b, also found by 0xNineDec and StErMi_

The security of the `Yieldy` contract is delegated to the compiler used.

### [](#proof-of-concept-3)Proof of Concept

The `allowance` of an account does not have to reflect the real balance of an account, however in the `transferFrom` method, it is the value that is checked in order to verify that the user has enough balance to make the transfer.

        function transferFrom(
            address _from,
            address _to,
            uint256 _value
        ) public override returns (bool) {
            require(_allowances[_from][msg.sender] >= _value, "Allowance too low");

However, the real balance of the `Yieldy` contract is based on the calculation made by the `creditsForTokenBalance` method, so an underflow could be made in the subtraction of the balance of the `from` account.

            uint256 creditAmount = creditsForTokenBalance(_value);
            creditBalances[_from] = creditBalances[_from] - creditAmount;
            creditBalances[_to] = creditBalances[_to] + creditAmount;
            emit Transfer(_from, _to, _value);

This means that the security of the contract is delegated to the checks added by the compiler depending on the pragma used, it must be taken into account that these checks may appear and disappear in future versions of the compiler, so they must be checked at the level of smart contracts.

Affected source code:

*   [Yieldy.sol#L212](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-yieldy/blob/8400e637d9259b7917bde259a5a2fbbeb5946d45/src/contracts/Yieldy.sol#L212)

### [](#recommended-mitigation-steps-4)Recommended Mitigation Steps

*   Check that the from account has a `creditAmount` balance.

> Looking into this, the balance isn’t calculated through the `creditsForTokenBalance` method, it’s calculated through the `balanceOf` method, which in this case the functionality is correct. We aren’t transferring credits, we are transferring the value and adding to the credits. Allowance is for value amounts, not credits, also balance can only go up against credits, so if the balance is valid then credits are inherently valid too. I’m unsure of what to label this as, because we do need to check to see if the user has the correct balance. I feel like this issue is partially correct.

### [](#impact-2)Impact

Function `rebase()` in contract `Staking` calls `Yieldy.rebase(profit, )` and `Yieldy.rebase(profit, )` would revert if `rebasingCredits / updatedTotalSupply` was equal to `0`. it’s possible to transfer some `STAKING_TOKEN` directly to `Stacking` contract before or after deployment of `Staking` and make `rebasingCredits / updatedTotalSupply` equal to `0`, and then most of the functionalities of `Staking` would not work because they call `rebase()` which will revert. it’s possible to perform this DOS for any token by transferring some tokens `STAKING_TOKEN` to contract address and then staking `1 wei` in contract. or for tokens with low precisions and low price it’s even possible to perform when `totalSupply()` of `Yieldy` is low.

Also attacker can only make `rebasingCredits / updatedTotalSupply` too low and so rounding error would be significant when `rebasingCredits / updatedTotalSupply` gets too low and users funds would be lost because of rounding error.

### [](#proof-of-concept-4)Proof of Concept

This is `rebase()` code in `Yieldy`:

        function rebase(uint256 _profit, uint256 _epoch)
            external
            onlyRole(REBASE_ROLE)
        {
            uint256 currentTotalSupply = _totalSupply;
            require(_totalSupply > 0, "Can't rebase if not circulating");
    
            if (_profit == 0) {
                emit LogSupply(_epoch, block.timestamp, currentTotalSupply);
                emit LogRebase(_epoch, 0, getIndex());
            } else {
                uint256 updatedTotalSupply = currentTotalSupply + _profit;
    
                if (updatedTotalSupply > MAX_SUPPLY) {
                    updatedTotalSupply = MAX_SUPPLY;
                }
    
                rebasingCreditsPerToken = rebasingCredits / updatedTotalSupply;
                require(rebasingCreditsPerToken > 0, "Invalid change in supply");
    
                _totalSupply = updatedTotalSupply;
    
                _storeRebase(updatedTotalSupply, _profit, _epoch);
            }
        }

As you can see if `rebasingCredits / updatedTotalSupply == 0` then the code will revert. `updatedTotalSupply` is equal to `_totalSupply + _profit` and `rebasingCredits` is `wad` in the first. `Yieldy.rebase(profit,)` is called by `Staking.rebase()`:

        function rebase() public {
            // we know about the issues surrounding block.timestamp, using it here will not cause any problems
            if (epoch.endTime <= block.timestamp) {
                IYieldy(YIELDY_TOKEN).rebase(epoch.distribute, epoch.number);
    
                epoch.endTime = epoch.endTime + epoch.duration;
                epoch.timestamp = block.timestamp;
                epoch.number++;
    
                uint256 balance = contractBalance();
                uint256 staked = IYieldy(YIELDY_TOKEN).totalSupply();
    
                if (balance <= staked) {
                    epoch.distribute = 0;
                } else {
                    epoch.distribute = balance - staked;
                }
            }
        }

As you can see the value of `_profit` is set to `epoch.distribute` which is `contractBalance() - IYieldy(YIELDY_TOKEN).totalSupply()` and `contractBalance()` is sum of `STAKING_TOKEN` and `TOKE` balance of `Staking` contract. so if attacker transfers `X` amount of `STAKCING_TOKEN` directly to `Staking` contract then the value of `_profit` which is going to send to `Yieldy.rebase(profit,)` would be higher than `X`. to exploit this attacker call `stake(1 wei)` after `Staking` deployment and then transfer `STAKING_TOKEN` directly to contract. then the value of `rebasingCredits` in `Yieldy` would be `2 wad` and the value of `_profit` sent to `Yieldy.rebase(profit,)` would be bigger than `2 wad` and `rebasingCredits / updatedTotalSupply` would be `0` and from now on all calls to `Staking.rebase()` would revert and that means functions `Stake()` and `instantUnstakeReserve()` and `instantUnstakeCurve()` wouldnt work anymore.

It’s possible to perform this attack for low precision tokens with low price `STAKING_TOKEN` too. the only thing attacker needs to do is that in early stage of `Staking` deployment sends more than `rebasingCredits` of `STAKING_TOKEN` token directly to `Staking` contract address. then in `rebase()` contract send that amount as `profit` to `Yieldy.rebase()` and that call would revert which will cause most of the logics of `Staking` to revert and not work.

and when `rebasingCredits / updatedTotalSupply` is low, the rounding error would be high enough that the compounding yield won’t show itself. attacker can make `rebasingCredits / updatedTotalSupply` too low but not `0` and from then user’s funds would be lost because of rounding error (wrong number of `Yieldy` token would be mint for user).

Using the `burn()` function of `Yieldy`, an address with `MINTER_BURNER_ROLE` can burn an arbitrary amount of tokens from any address.

We believe this is unnecessary and poses a serious centralization risk.

A malicious or compromised `MINTER_BURNER_ROLE` address can take advantage of this.

### [](#recommended-mitigation-steps-6)Recommended Mitigation Steps

Consider removing the `MINTER_BURNER_ROLE` and change `burn()` function to:

        function burn(uint256 _amount) external override 
        {
            _burn(_msgSender(), _amount);
        }

Issue: there is a huge arb opportunity for people who deposit 1 block before the `rebase()`.

Consequences: then they can call `instantUnstakeReserve` or `instantUnstakeCurve` to unstake the staked amount, in this way the profit that needs to be distributed on the next rebase increases, he also messes up the rewards for the other holders as the `instantUnstakeReserve` does not burn the `YIELD_TOKEN`. Even if there is a fee on the `instantUnstakeReserve`, there is still a chance for profit.

It is possible to get an out-of-gas issue while iterating the for loop.

Let’s say I want to run the function on [`BatchRequests.sol#L14`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-yieldy/blob/main/src/contracts/BatchRequests.sol#L14) and I got a lot of [`contracts`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-yieldy/blob/main/src/contracts/BatchRequests.sol#L9) pending for withdrawal.

User is able to withdraw unstaked asset sooner than they should be.

### [](#proof-of-concept-6)Proof of Concept

`Unstake()` allows the user to bypass the rebase() call by setting \_trigger to false. Since rebase() is bypassed, epoch.number could potentially be stale i.e. doesn’t match the Tokemak epoch. A user could potentially call unstake() with \_trigger = false immediately after an epoch has ended but expiry would be set using the stale epoch.number because it wouldn’t be updated by rebase(). This would allow the user to withdraw early before their funds were actually available in the contract because their withdrawal would be considered to be in the epoch before they actually initiated the withdrawal.

### [](#recommended-mitigation-steps-9)Recommended Mitigation Steps

`Rebase()` cannot be optional when calling unstake.

Some user withdrawals won’t be available for withdrawal even though it should be.

### [](#proof-of-concept-7)Proof of Concept

`sendWithdrawalRequest` can only happen once per cycle. canBatchTransactions (L386) must return true for the actual withdrawal request to happen. It checks in L362 that currentCycleIndex > lastTokeCycleIndex and in L397 of sendWithdrawlRequest, lastTokeCycleIndex = currentCycleIndex. This means that for the rest of the cycle, canBatchTransactions will return false. This means that if a user requests a withdrawal towards the end of epoch after the withdrawal has been submitted but before the end of the epoch, their withdrawal will be set to the current epoch but the actual token amount of their withdrawal won’t be processed. This will lead to a discrepancy between the number of tokens withdrawn and the number of tokens allowed to be withdrawn by users, which means that not all users who are “eligible” for withdrawal will actually be able to withdraw because there won’t be enough tokens for everyone.

### [](#recommended-mitigation-steps-10)Recommended Mitigation Steps

The requirement in L362 should be removed. As noted in the contract, “TOKE’s requestWithdrawal overwriting the amount if you call it more than once per cycle”. Overwriting the withdrawal is perfectly okay though because it already uses requestWithdrawalAmount which is a cumulative measure of the tokens that need to be withdrawn because it is only decreased when the asset it actually received from a withdrawal.

Rebases can be frontrun with very little token downtime even when `warmUpPeriod > 0`.

A user can call stake the block before epoch.endTime <= block.timestamp, allowing the user to bypass the forced rebase called in L416 of the the stake function. If warmUpPeriod > 0 then the user will receive a “warmUpInfo” with the value of their deposit. The very next block, the user can then call instantUnstakeCurve.

[https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-yieldy/blob/524f3b83522125fb7d4677fa7a7e5ba5a2c0fe67/src/contracts/Staking.sol#L600-L627](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-yieldy/blob/524f3b83522125fb7d4677fa7a7e5ba5a2c0fe67/src/contracts/Staking.sol#L600-L627)

This will call rebase again in L633 and this time epoch.endTime <= block.timestamp will be true and it will trigger an actual rebase, distributing the pending rewards. \_retrieveBalanceFromUser (L617) will then allows the user to unstake all the funds locked in warm up. The issue is that when unstaking it uses userWarmInfo.credits meaning that any rebalance rewards are kept. This allows the user to get in, collect the rebase, then immediately get out.

### [](#recommended-mitigation-steps-11)Recommended Mitigation Steps

Being able to unstake tokens even when in the warm up period is a useful feature but tokens unstaked during that period should not be allowed to accumulate any rebases or it can lead to situations like this. L537-L539 should be changed to: `warmUpBalance = userWarmInfo.amount`.

Users of `moveFundsToUpgradedContract()` in migration.sol may forfeit rebase rewards.

### [](#proof-of-concept-9)Proof of Concept

L54 calls instantUnstake(false) meaning that it skips the optional rebase. If there is a pending rebase then the user calling the function will not get this rebase and miss out on potential rewards.

### [](#recommended-mitigation-steps-12)Recommended Mitigation Steps

Add an input bool `\_trigger` then add the following code to the start of the function:

if (\_trigger) { rebase(); }

This allows users to optionally call rebase if they are concerned about losing pending rebase rewards.

`Staking.setCurvePool()` allows the owner to set a new `CURVE_POOL` address, however, there is no way to set token approvals to the new address. The only calls to `token.approve()` are found in the constructor. Therefore, there’s no true way to set a new curve pool. All calls to `ICurvePool(CURVE_POOL).exchange()` will fail.

There are ERC20 tokens that may make certain customizations to their ERC20 contracts.

One type of these tokens is deflationary tokens that charge a certain fee for every `transfer()` or `transferFrom()`.

When `IERC20Upgradeable(TOKE_TOKEN)` get set to `totalTokeAmount` it will be different once `safetransfer` have fees as some types of tokens may charge a certain fee for transfer and transferfrom.

It may be better to get the before balance then `safetransferfrom` then get the after balance to make sure no fees were added.

The function `BatchRequests.sendWithdrawalRequests` allows calling the `sendWithdrawalRequests` function on all of the Yieldy contracts at once.

**Note: this issue had originally been grouped with M-15. Approximately 1 week after judging and awarding were finalized, the judging team re-assessed that this issue should have been classified as a unique issue. It has been broken out here accordingly.**

[https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-yieldy/blob/main/src/contracts/Yieldy.sol#L91](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-yieldy/blob/main/src/contracts/Yieldy.sol#L91)

It was observed that if updatedTotalSupply > MAX_SUPPLY then updatedTotalSupply becomes MAX_SUPPLY. This means \_profit amount is not fully used. But \_storeRebase function is still called with \_profit amount.

This becomes a problem since \_storeRebase function caluclates rebasePercent using this incorrect \_profit amount.

### [](#proof-of-concept-12)Proof of Concept

1.  REBASE\_ROLE calls rebase function with say profit 10. Assume currentTotalSupply is 90
2.  updatedTotalSupply is calculated as updatedTotalSupply = currentTotalSupply + \_profit. Thus updatedTotalSupply becomes 90+10=100
3.  Assume MAX_SUPPLY is 91. Since updatedTotalSupply>MAX_SUPPLY so updatedTotalSupply is updated to be 91
4.  Now \_storeRebase function is called with updatedTotalSupply (91), \_profit(10)
5.  This is incorrect since 10 amount from \_profit is not utilized and only 1 amount is utilized. This becomes a problem in rebasePercent calculation where it is calculated on full 10 amount instead of 1

### [](#recommended-mitigation-steps-16)Recommended Mitigation Steps

Use below:

    if (updatedTotalSupply > MAX_SUPPLY) {
    _profit=_profit - (updatedTotalSupply-MAX_SUPPLY);
                    updatedTotalSupply = MAX_SUPPLY;

### [](#impact-5)Impact

If the token is deflationary then contract will receive less token that requested `amount` but contract don’t check for the real transferred amount. because this is happening in receiving `stacking_token` in `addLiquidity()` of `LiquidityReserve` and `stake()` of `Staking` then those logics for minting `YIELDY_TOKEN` or `LP` token is wrong. (contract receive less than `amount` but mint or transfer `amount` to user). This can cause other users which staked to lose funds.

This is the related code where transfer happens (`stake()` and `addLiquidity()`):

            require(!isStakingPaused, "Staking is paused");
            // amount must be non zero
            require(_amount > 0, "Must have valid amount");
    
            uint256 yieldyTotalSupply = IYieldy(YIELDY_TOKEN).totalSupply();
    
            // Don't rebase unless tokens are already staked or could get locked out of staking
            if (yieldyTotalSupply > 0) {
                rebase();
            }

            uint256 lrFoxSupply = totalSupply();
            uint256 coolDownAmount = IStaking(stakingContract)
                .coolDownInfo(address(this))

                msg.sender,
                address(this),

            );
            _mint(msg.sender, amountToMint);
        }

As you can see contract transfers `amount` of `STAKE_TOKEN` and assumes it is going to receive that amount and then mint the same `amount` of `YIELDY_TOKEN` or `LP` token. So user receive more funds which belongs to other users. protocol logics are not suitable for deflationary tokens and funds would be lost.

In the staking contract, the rebase function can only be called once per epoch.

In the rebase function, the rewards of the current epoch are used in the next epoch, which can cause the rewards to be updated incorrectly and lead to incorrect distribution of user rewards.

        function rebase() public {
            // we know about the issues surrounding block.timestamp, using it here will not cause any problems
            if (epoch.endTime <= block.timestamp) {
                IYieldy(YIELDY_TOKEN).rebase(epoch.distribute, epoch.number); // 懒更新
    
                epoch.endTime = epoch.endTime + epoch.duration;
                epoch.timestamp = block.timestamp;
                epoch.number++;
    
                uint256 balance = contractBalance();
                uint256 staked = IYieldy(YIELDY_TOKEN).totalSupply();
    
                if (balance <= staked) {
                    epoch.distribute = 0;
                } else {
                    epoch.distribute = balance - staked;

Users may be unable to withdraw/remove their liquidity from the `LiquidityReserve` if a user decides to grief the contract.

### [](#proof-of-concept-15)Proof of Concept

This is the only function in this contract that is able to unstake funds, so that they can be withdrawn/removed:

    File: src/contracts/LiquidityReserve.sol   #1
    
    214       function unstakeAllRewardTokens() public {
    215           require(isReserveEnabled, "Not enabled yet");
    216           uint256 coolDownAmount = IStaking(stakingContract)
    217               .coolDownInfo(address(this))
    218               .amount;
    219           if (coolDownAmount == 0) {
    220               uint256 amount = IERC20Upgradeable(rewardToken).balanceOf(
    221                   address(this)
    222               );
    223               if (amount > 0) IStaking(stakingContract).unstake(amount, false);
    224           }
    225       }

[https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-yieldy/blob/524f3b83522125fb7d4677fa7a7e5ba5a2c0fe67/src/contracts/LiquidityReserve.sol#L214-L225](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-yieldy/blob/524f3b83522125fb7d4677fa7a7e5ba5a2c0fe67/src/contracts/LiquidityReserve.sol#L214-L225)

The function requires that the `coolDownAmount` is zero, or else it skips the `unstake()` call. A malicious user can make `coolDownAmount` non-zero by calling `Staking.instantUnstakeReserve()` when the previous reward is claimed, with just a large enough amount to satisfy the transfer of the amount and of the fee, so there is essentially zero left for other users to withdraw. The function calls `LiquidityReserve.instantUnstake()`:

    File: src/contracts/Staking.sol   #2
    
    571       function instantUnstakeReserve(uint256 _amount) external {
    572           require(_amount > 0, "Invalid amount");
    573           // prevent unstaking if override due to vulnerabilities
    574           require(
    575               !isUnstakingPaused && !isInstantUnstakingPaused,
    576               "Unstaking is paused"
    577           );
    578   
    579           rebase();
    580           _retrieveBalanceFromUser(_amount, msg.sender);
    581   
    582           uint256 reserveBalance = IERC20Upgradeable(STAKING_TOKEN).balanceOf(
    583               LIQUIDITY_RESERVE
    584           );
    585   
    586           require(reserveBalance >= _amount, "Not enough funds in reserve");
    587   
    588           ILiquidityReserve(LIQUIDITY_RESERVE).instantUnstake(
    589               _amount,
    590               msg.sender
    591           );
    592       }

[https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-yieldy/blob/524f3b83522125fb7d4677fa7a7e5ba5a2c0fe67/src/contracts/Staking.sol#L571-L592](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-yieldy/blob/524f3b83522125fb7d4677fa7a7e5ba5a2c0fe67/src/contracts/Staking.sol#L571-L592)

If the malicious user is a miner, that miner can make sure that the block where the previous cooldown expires and is claimed, is the same block where the miner griefs by doing an instant unstake of a small amount, preventing larger amounts from going through. Until the miner decides to stop this behavior, funds will be locked in the contract.

### [](#recommended-mitigation-steps-20)Recommended Mitigation Steps

Keep track of submitted amounts during the cooldown, and batch-submit them during the next open window, rather than making it first-come-first-served

In the Yieldy contract, functions such as balanceOf/creditsForTokenBalance/tokenBalanceForCredits/transfer/transferFrom/burn/mint will use the rebasingCreditsPerToken variable, so before calling these functions in the Staking contract, make sure that the rebase of this epoch has occurred. Therefore, the rebase function should also be called in the unstake/claim/claimWithdraw function of the Staking contract.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

_Submitted by unforgiven_

Function `addLiquidity()` suppose to do add Liquidity for the `staking Token` and receive `lrToken` in exchange. to calculate amount of `IrToken` codes uses this calculation: `amountToMint = (_amount * lrFoxSupply) / totalLockedValue` but it’s possible for attacker to manipulate `totalLockedValue` (by sending tokens directly to `LiquidityReserve` address) and make `totalLockedValue/lrFoxSupply` very high in early stage of contract deployment so because of rounding error in calculation of `amountToMint` the users would receive very lower `IrToken` and users funds would be lost and attacker can steal them.

Attacker can perform this attack by sending tokens before even `LiquidityReserve` deployed because the contract address would be predictable and attacker can perform front-run or sandwich attack too.

Also it’s possible to perform this attack for `STAKING_TOKEN` with low precision and low price even if `LiquidityReserve` had some balances.

### [](#proof-of-concept-17)Proof of Concept

This is `addLiquidity()` code in `LiquidityReserve`:

        function addLiquidity(uint256 _amount) external {
            require(isReserveEnabled, "Not enabled yet");
            uint256 stakingTokenBalance = IERC20Upgradeable(stakingToken).balanceOf(
                address(this)
            );
            uint256 rewardTokenBalance = IERC20Upgradeable(rewardToken).balanceOf(
                address(this)
            );
            uint256 lrFoxSupply = totalSupply();
            uint256 coolDownAmount = IStaking(stakingContract)
                .coolDownInfo(address(this))
                .amount;
            uint256 totalLockedValue = stakingTokenBalance +
                rewardTokenBalance +
                coolDownAmount;
    
            uint256 amountToMint = (_amount * lrFoxSupply) / totalLockedValue;
            IERC20Upgradeable(stakingToken).safeTransferFrom(
                msg.sender,
                address(this),
                _amount
            );
            _mint(msg.sender, amountToMint);
        }

As you can see code uses this calculation: `amountToMint = (_amount * lrFoxSupply) / totalLockedValue;` to find the amount of `IrToken` that is going to mint for user. but attacker can send `stakingToken` or `rewardToken` directly to `LiquidityReserve` address when the there is no liqudity in the contract and make `totalLockedValue` very high. then attacker call `addLiquidity()` and mint some `IrToken` for himself and from then anyone tries to call `addLiquidity()` because of rounding error is going to lose some funds (receives less `IrToken` than he is supposed to)

Whale who provided most liquidity to the contract can simply use removeLiquidity function and can remove all of his liquidity. This can leave the residual liquidity to be less than MINIMUM\_LIQUIDITY which is incorrect.

### [](#proof-of-concept-19)Proof of Concept

1.  Whale A provided initial liquidity plus more liquidity using enableLiquidityReserve and addLiquidity function
2.  There are other small liquidity providers as well
3.  Now Whale A decides to remove all the liquidity provided
4.  This means after liquidity removal the balance liquidity will even drop below MINIMUM\_LIQUIDITY which is incorrect

### [](#recommended-mitigation-steps-24)Recommended Mitigation Steps

Add below check

    require(

`\_requestWithdrawalFromTokemak` function :: Instead of sending amountToRequest for requestWithdrawal, contract is asking \_amount for requestWithdrawal. This becomes a problem when balance < \_amount and only balance could be withdrawn

### [](#proof-of-concept-20)Proof of Concept

1.  In \_requestWithdrawalFromTokemak function, amountToRequest is calculated as

    // the only way balance < _amount is when using unstakeAllFromTokemak
            uint256 amountToRequest = balance < _amount ? balance : _amount;

2.  Now assuming balance < \_amount then amountToRequest becomes balance
3.  But tokePoolContract.requestWithdrawal is called over \_amount instead of amountToRequest which means withdrawal is requested over an extra amount

### [](#recommended-mitigation-steps-25)Recommended Mitigation Steps

Modify Staking.sol#L326 to

    if (amountToRequest > 0) tokePoolContract.requestWithdrawal(amountToRequest);

_Submitted by Alex the Entreprenerd_

The function `preSign` accepts any `orderUid`.  
`function preSign(bytes calldata orderUid) external onlyOwner`

Because of how Cowswap works, accepting any `orderUid` can be used as a rug-vector.

This is because the orderData contains a `receiver` which in lack of validation could be any address.

You’d also be signing other parameters such as minOut and how long the order could be filled for, which you may or may not want to validate to give stronger security guarantees to end users.

### [](#recomended-mitigation-steps)Recomended Mitigation Steps

I’d recommend adding basic validation for tokenOut, minOut and receiver.

Feel free to check the work we’ve done at Badger to validate order parameters, giving way stronger guarantees to end users.

_Submitted by Lambda_

In the constructor of `Staking.sol`, it is not enforced that the `_firstEpochEndTime` is larger than the current `block.timestamp`. If a low value is accidentally passed (or even 0), `rebase` can be called multiple times in sucession, causing the `epoch.number` to increase. Therefore, the coolDown & warmUp period can be circumvented in such a scenario, as `epoch.number >= info.expiry` (in `_isClaimAvailable` and `_isClaimWithdrawAvailable`) will return true after `rebase` caused several increases of `epoch.number`.

### [](#recommended-mitigation-steps-26)Recommended Mitigation Steps

Either require that `_firstEpochEndTime` is larger than `block.timestamp` or set the expiry of the first epoch to `block.timestamp + _epochDuration`.

[`instantUnstake()`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-yieldy/blob/main/src/contracts/LiquidityReserve.sol#L188) allows user to unstake their stakingToken for a fee paid to the liquidity providers. This fee could be changed up to 100% any moment by admin.

Malicious admin could frontrun users [`instantUnstake()`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-yieldy/blob/main/src/contracts/LiquidityReserve.sol#L188) transaction and set `fee` to any value (using [`setFee()`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-yieldy/blob/main/src/contracts/LiquidityReserve.sol#L92)) and get all users unstaking asset.

It’s even could lead to a situation when non-malicious admin accidentally frontrun unstaking user by increasing fee to a new rate, which user wasn’t expected.

        /**
            @notice sets Fee (in basis points eg. 100 bps = 1%) for instant unstaking
            @param _fee uint - fee in basis points

            // check range before setting fee
            require(_fee <= BASIS_POINTS, "Out of range");
            fee = _fee;
    
            emit FeeChanged(_fee);
        }

### [](#recommended-mitigation-steps-27)Recommended Mitigation Steps

Consider introducing an upper limit for fees so users can know the maximum fess available in protocol and adding timelock to change fee size. This way, frontrunning will be impossible, and users will know which fee they agree to.

_Submitted by skoorch_

Users can utilize the `instantUnstake` function without paying the liquidity provider fee using rounding errors in the fee calculation. This attack only allows for a relatively small amount of tokens to be unstaked in each call, so is likely not feasible on mainnet. However, on low-cost L2s and for tokens with a small decimal precision it is likely a feasible workaround.

### [](#proof-of-concept-21)Proof of Concept

The `instantUnstake` fee is handled by sending the user back `amount - fee`. We can work around the fee by unstaking small amounts (`amount < BASIS_POINTS / fee`) in a loop until reaching the desired amount.

### [](#recommended-mitigation-steps-28)Recommended Mitigation Steps

Avoid using subtraction to calculate the fee as this causes the fee to be rounded down rather than the amount. I’d propose calculating amount less fee using a muldiv operation over (1 - fee). In this case, the fee is effectively rounded up instead of down, so it can never be 0 unless fee is 0. Uniswapv2 uses a similar solution for their LP fee: [https://github.com/Uniswap/v2-core/blob/8b82b04a0b9e696c0e83f8b2f00e5d7be6888c79/contracts/UniswapV2Pair.sol#L180-L182](https://github.com/Uniswap/v2-core/blob/8b82b04a0b9e696c0e83f8b2f00e5d7be6888c79/contracts/UniswapV2Pair.sol#L180-L182)

It might look like the following:

    uint256 amountMinusFee = amount * (BASIS_POINTS - fee) / BASIS_POINTS

[](#l-01-batch-related-functions-will-revert-if-removeaddress-is-called)\[L-01\] Batch-related functions will revert if `removeAddress()` is called
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

`removeAddress()` removes entries from the storage array that holds batch contract addresses, but it doesn’t fill in the deleted entries with a replacement value. When other functions hit these null entries and try to call functions on the zero address, they’ll revert, causing the whole function to fail

There may be a mismatch between the token that `_stakingContract` is in charge of, and the actual token used by the `LiquidityReserve`. This code should check that they are in fact the same

[](#l-03-missing-infinite-approval-functionality)\[L-03\] Missing infinite approval functionality
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Most other contracts in the repository use `type(uint256).max` to mean infinite approval, rather than a specific approval amount. Not doing the same thing here will mean inconsistent behavior between the components, will mean that approvals will eventually run down to zero, and will mean that there will be hard-to-track-down issues when things eventually start failing

The following instances are missing checks for zero addresses and or valid ranges for values. Even if the DAO is the one setting these values, it’s important to add sanity checks in case someone does a fat-finger operation that is missed by DAO participants who may not be very technical. There are also no timelocks involved, which [should be rectified](https://discord.com/channels/810916927919620096/986765994049564682/990255967847460894)

In the worst case, the owner does not notice that his/her call reverts, and everyone starts using a contract under the control of an attacker

Not all `IERC20` implementations `revert()` when there’s a failure in `approve()`. The function signature has a `boolean` return value and they indicate errors that way instead. By not checking the return value, operations that should have marked as failed, may potentially go through without actually approving anything

[](#g-02-wrong-use-of-the-memory-keyword-for-a-struct)\[G-02\] Wrong use of the `memory` keyword for a Struct
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When copying a state struct in memory, there are as many SLOADs and MSTOREs as there are slots. When reading the whole struct multiple times is not needed, it’s better to actually only read the relevant field(s). When only some of the fields are read several times, these particular values should be cached instead of the whole state struct.

Here, the `storage` keyword should be used instead of `memory`:

The code can be optimized by minimizing the number of SLOADs.

SLOADs are expensive (100 gas after the 1st one) compared to MLOADs/MSTOREs (3 gas each). Storage values read multiple times should instead be cached in memory the first time (costing 1 SLOAD) and then read from this cache to avoid multiple SLOADs.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Up until Solidity `0.8.13`: `!= 0` costs less gas compared to `> 0` for unsigned integers in `require` statements with the optimizer enabled (6 gas)

Proof: While it may seem that `> 0` is cheaper than `!=`, this is only true without the optimizer enabled and outside a require statement. If you enable the optimizer AND you’re in a `require` statement, this will save gas. You can see this tweet for more proofs: [https://twitter.com/gzeon/status/1485428085885640706](https://twitter.com/gzeon/status/1485428085885640706)

Also, please enable the Optimizer.

Strict inequalities (`>`) are more expensive than non-strict ones (`>=`). This is due to some supplementary checks (ISZERO, 3 gas). This also holds true between `<=` and `<`.

[](#g-14-amounts-should-be-checked-for-0-before-calling-a-transfer)\[G-14\] Amounts should be checked for 0 before calling a transfer
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Checking non-zero transfer values can avoid an expensive external call and save gas.

Consider adding a non-zero-value check here:

    LiquidityReserve.sol:177:        IERC20Upgradeable(stakingToken).safeTransfer(

[](#g-15-i-costs-less-gas-compared-to-i-or-i--1-same-for---i-vs-i---or-i---1)\[G-15\] `++i` costs less gas compared to `i++` or `i += 1` (same for `--i` vs `i--` or `i -= 1`)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Pre-increments and pre-decrements are cheaper.

For a `uint256 i` variable, the following is true with the Optimizer enabled at 10k:

**Increment:**

*   `i += 1` is the most expensive form
*   `i++` costs 6 gas less than `i += 1`
*   `++i` costs 5 gas less than `i++` (11 gas less than `i += 1`)

**Decrement:**

*   `i -= 1` is the most expensive form
*   `i--` costs 11 gas less than `i -= 1`
*   `--i` costs 5 gas less than `i--` (16 gas less than `i -= 1`)

Note that post-increments (or post-decrements) return the old value before incrementing or decrementing, hence the name _post-increment_:

    uint i = 1;  
    uint j = 2;
    require(j == i++, "This will be false as i is incremented after the comparison");

However, pre-increments (or pre-decrements) return the new value:

    uint i = 1;  
    uint j = 2;
    require(j == ++i, "This will be true as i is incremented before the comparison");

In the pre-increment case, the compiler has to create a temporary variable (when used) for returning `1` instead of `2`.

Affected code:

    Staking.sol:708:            epoch.number++;

Consider using pre-increments and pre-decrements where they are relevant (meaning: not where post-increments/decrements logic are relevant).

[](#g-16-public-functions-to-external)\[G-16\] Public functions to external
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

An external call cost is less expensive than one of a public function. The following functions could be set external to save gas and improve code quality (extracted from Slither).

    Staking.sol:370:    function unstakeAllFromTokemak() public onlyOwner {

[](#g-17-it-costs-more-gas-to-initialize-variables-with-their-default-value-than-letting-the-default-value-be-applied)\[G-17\] It costs more gas to initialize variables with their default value than letting the default value be applied
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If a variable is not set/initialized, it is assumed to have the default value (`0` for `uint`, `false` for `bool`, `address(0)` for address…). Explicitly initializing it with its default value is an anti-pattern and wastes gas.

As an example: `for (uint256 i = 0; i < numIterations; ++i) {` should be replaced with `for (uint256 i; i < numIterations; ++i) {`

Affected code:

    Staking.sol:636:            int128 from = 0;
    Staking.sol:637:            int128 to = 0;

Consider removing explicit initializations for default values.

[](#g-18-upgrade-pragma)\[G-18\] Upgrade pragma
-----------------------------------------------

Using newer compiler versions and the optimizer give gas optimizations. Also, additional safety checks are available for free.

The advantages here are:

*   **Contract existence checks** (>= 0.8.10): external calls skip contract existence checks if the external call has a return value

Consider upgrading here :

[](#g-19-use-custom-errors-instead-of-revert-strings-to-save-gas)\[G-19\] Use Custom Errors instead of Revert Strings to save Gas
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Solidity 0.8.4 introduced custom errors. They are more gas efficient than revert strings, when it comes to deploy cost as well as runtime cost when the revert condition is met. Use custom errors instead of revert strings for gas savings.

Custom errors from Solidity 0.8.4 are cheaper than revert strings (cheaper deployment cost and runtime cost when the revert condition is met)

Source: [https://blog.soliditylang.org/2021/04/21/custom-errors/](https://blog.soliditylang.org/2021/04/21/custom-errors/):

> Starting from [Solidity v0.8.4](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/releases/tag/v0.8.4), there is a convenient and gas-efficient way to explain to users why an operation failed through the use of custom errors. Until now, you could already use strings to give more information about failures (e.g., `revert("Insufficient funds.");`), but they are rather expensive, especially when it comes to deploy cost, and it is difficult to use dynamic information in them.

Custom errors are defined using the `error` statement, which can be used inside and outside of contracts (including interfaces and libraries).

Consider replacing all revert strings with custom errors in the solution.

If a function modifier such as `onlyOwner` is used, the function will revert if a normal user tries to pay the function. Marking the function as `payable` will lower the gas cost for legitimate callers because the compiler will not include checks for whether a payment was provided.
