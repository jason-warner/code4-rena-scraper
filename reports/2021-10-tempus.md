[](#about-c4)About C4
---------------------

Code 432n4 (C4) is an open organization consisting of security researchers, auditors, developers, and individuals with domain expertise in smart contracts.

A C4 code contest is an event in which community participants, referred to as Wardens, review, audit, or analyze smart contract logic in exchange for a bounty provided by sponsoring projects.

During the code contest outlined in this document, C4 conducted an analysis of Tempus Finance contest smart contract system written in Solidity. The code contest took place between October 14—October 20 2021.

[](#wardens)Wardens

This contest was judged by [0xean](https://github.com/0xean).

Final report assembled by [itsmetechjay](https://twitter.com/itsmetechjay) and [CloudEllie](https://twitter.com/CloudEllie1).

[](#summary)Summary
===================

The C4 analysis yielded an aggregated total of 8 unique vulnerabilities and 37 total findings. All of the issues presented here are linked back to their original finding.

Of these vulnerabilities, 1 received a risk rating in the category of HIGH severity, 2 received a risk rating in the category of MEDIUM severity, and 5 received a risk rating in the category of LOW severity.

C4 analysis also identified 12 non-critical recommendations and 16 gas optimizations.

[](#scope)Scope
===============

The code under review can be found within the [C4 Tempus Finance contest repository](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-10-tempus), and is composed of 40 smart contracts written in the Solidity programming language, and includes 3,903 lines of Solidity code.

[](#severity-criteria)Severity Criteria
=======================================

C4 assesses the severity of disclosed vulnerabilities according to a methodology based on [OWASP standards](https://owasp.org/www-community/OWASP_Risk_Rating_Methodology).

Vulnerabilities are divided into three primary risk categories: high, medium, and low.

High-level considerations for vulnerabilities span the following key areas when conducting assessments:

*   Malicious Input Handling
*   Escalation of privileges
*   Arithmetic
*   Gas use

Further information regarding the severity criteria referenced throughout the submission review process, please refer to the documentation provided on [the C4 website](https://code423n4.com).

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### [](#impact)Impact

The function `\_depositAndProvideLiquidity` can be used go retrieve arbitrary ERC20 tokens from the TempusController.sol contract.

As the test contract of TempusController.sol [https://goerli.etherscan.io/address/0xd4330638b87f97ec1605d7ec7d67ea1de5dd7aaa](https://goerli.etherscan.io/address/0xd4330638b87f97ec1605d7ec7d67ea1de5dd7aaa) shows, it has indeed ERC20 tokens.

The problem is due to the fact that you supply an arbitrary tempusAMM to depositAndProvideLiquidity and thus to `\_depositAndProvideLiquidity`. tempusAMM could be a fake contract that supplies values that are completely fake.

At the end of the function `\_depositAndProvideLiquidity`, ERC20 tokens are send to the user. If you can manipulate the variables ammTokens, mintedShares and sharesUsed you can send back any tokens held in the contract “ammTokens\[0\].safeTransfer(msg.sender, mintedShares - sharesUsed\[0\]);”

The Proof of Concept shows an approach to do this.

#### [](#proof-of-concept)Proof of Concept

*   [https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-10-tempus/blob/63f7639aad08f2bba717830ed81e0649f7fc23ee/contracts/TempusController.sol#L73-L79](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-10-tempus/blob/63f7639aad08f2bba717830ed81e0649f7fc23ee/contracts/TempusController.sol#L73-L79)

*   Create a fake Vault contract (fakeVault) with the following functions: `fakeVault.getPoolTokens(poolId)` —> returns {TokenToSteal1,TokenToSteal2},{fakeBalance1,fakeBalance2},0 `fakeVault.JoinPoolRequest()` —> do nothing `fakeVault.joinPool()` —> do nothing
*   Create a fake Pool contract (fakePool) with the following functions: `fakePool.yieldBearingToken()` —> returns fakeYieldBearingToken `fakePool.deposit()` —> returns fakeMintedShares,…
*   Create a fake ammTokens contract with the following functions: `tempusAMM.getVault()` —> returns fakeVault `tempusAMM.getPoolId()` —> returns 0 `tempusAMM.tempusPool()` —> returns fakePool
*   call depositAndProvideLiquidity(fakeTempusAMM,1,false) // false -> yieldBearingToken \_getAMMDetailsAndEnsureInitialized returns fakeVault,0, {token1,token2},{balance1,balance2} \_deposit(fakePool,1,false) calls \_depositYieldBearing which calls `fakePool.deposit()` and returns fakeMintedShares \_provideLiquidity(…) calculates a vale of ammLiquidityProvisionAmounts \_provideLiquidity(…) skips the safeTransferFrom because sender == address(this)) the calls to fakeVault.JoinPoolRequest() and fakeVault.joinPool() can be faked. \_provideLiquidity(…) returns the value ammLiquidityProvisionAmounts

Now fakeMintedShares - ammLiquidityProvisionAmounts number of TokenToSteal1 and TokenToSteal2 are transferred to msg.sender

As you can both manipulate TokenToSteal1 and fakeMintedShares, you can transfer any token to msg.sender

#### [](#recommended-mitigation-steps)Recommended Mitigation Steps

Create a whitelist for tempusAMMs

**[mijovic (Tempus) confirmed](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-10-tempus-findings/issues/10#issuecomment-946718849):**

> This is a good point. However, these tokens that are locked in `TempusController` are coming from dust that was left when the user is doing early redemption. As this needs to be done with equal shares, we have a threshold parameter that is used as the maximum leftover behind redemption (usually there is a need to do a swap before redemption to make this work). So, this is going to be pennies always.
> 
> I would not consider this as high risk, and we are not planning to fix this as steps to make this hack are too complicated to steal pennies… Also, the gas cost of doing it costs by far more than the funds that someone can steal.

**[mijovic (Tempus) commented](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-10-tempus-findings/issues/10#issuecomment-946905741):**

> We changed point of view here a little bit. Will add registry of TempusAMMs and TempusPools that can be used with controller, just to prevent possible attacks with fake amms and pools.

**[mijovic (Tempus) patched](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-10-tempus-findings/issues/10#issuecomment-948351797):**

> Added whitelist registry for both `TempusAMM` and `TempusPool` in this PR [https://github.com/tempus-finance/tempus-protocol/pull/365](https://github.com/tempus-finance/tempus-protocol/pull/365) However, as amount of tokens that TempusController holds is so small (I would say this is of severity 2)

**[0xean (judge) commented](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-10-tempus-findings/issues/10#issuecomment-954181571):**

> The C4 docs don’t speculate on the amount of assets stolen in the TLDR of risk assessment.
> 
>     3 — High: Assets can be stolen/lost/compromised directly (or indirectly if there is a valid attack path that does not have hand-wavy hypotheticals).
> 
> Given the fact that some amount of assets could be stolen, i believe this is the correct severity for the issue.

[](#medium-risk-findings-2)Medium Risk Findings (2)

[](#m-01-exittempusamm-can-be-made-to-fail)[\[M-01\] `exitTempusAMM` can be made to fail](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-10-tempus-findings/issues/21)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

_Submitted by cmichel_.

There’s a griefing attack where an attacker can make any user transaction for `TempusController.exitTempusAMM` fail. In `_exitTempusAMM`, the user exits their LP position and claims back yield and principal shares. The LP amounts to redeem are determined by the function parameter `lpTokensAmount`. A final `assert(tempusAMM.balanceOf(address(this)) == 0)` statement checks that the LP token amount of the contract is zero after the exit. This is only true if no other LP shares were already in the contract.

However, an attacker can frontrun this call and send the smallest unit of LP shares to the contract which then makes the original deposit-and-fix transaction fail.

#### [](#impact-1)Impact

All `exitTempusAMM` calls can be made to fail and this function becomes unusable.

#### [](#recommended-mitigation-steps-1)Recommended Mitigation Steps

Remove the `assert` check.

There’s a griefing attack where an attacker can make any user transaction for `TempusController.depositAndFix` fail. In `_depositAndFix`, `swapAmount` many yield shares are swapped to principal where `swapAmount` is derived from the function arguments. A final `assert(yieldShares.balanceOf(address(this)) == 0)` statement checks that the yield shares of the contract are zero after the swap. This is only true if no other yield shares were already in the contract.

However, an attacker can frontrun this call and send the smallest unit of yield shares to the contract which then makes the original deposit-and-fix transaction fail.
