[](#about-c4)About C4
---------------------

Code 432n4 (C4) is an open organization consisting of security researchers, auditors, developers, and individuals with domain expertise in smart contracts.

A C4 code contest is an event in which community participants, referred to as Wardens, review, audit, or analyze smart contract logic in exchange for a bounty provided by sponsoring projects.

During the code contest outlined in this document, C4 conducted an analysis of Swivel contest smart contract system written in Solidity. The code contest took place between September 30—October 6 2021.

[](#wardens)Wardens

Final report assembled by [CloudEllie](https://twitter.com/CloudEllie1) and [itsmetechjay](https://twitter.com/itsmetechjay).

[](#summary)Summary
===================

The C4 analysis yielded an aggregated total of 27 unique vulnerabilities and 76 total findings. All of the issues presented here are linked back to their original finding.

Of these vulnerabilities, 4 received a risk rating in the category of HIGH severity, 5 received a risk rating in the category of MEDIUM severity, and 18 received a risk rating in the category of LOW severity.

C4 analysis also identified 20 non-critical recommendations and 28 gas optimizations.

[](#scope)Scope
===============

The code under review can be found within the [C4 Swivel contest code repository](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-09-swivel), is composed of 3 smart contracts written in the Solidity programming language, and includes 996 lines of Solidity code.

[](#severity-criteria)Severity Criteria
=======================================

C4 assesses the severity of disclosed vulnerabilities according to a methodology based on [OWASP standards](https://owasp.org/www-community/OWASP_Risk_Rating_Methodology).

Vulnerabilities are divided into three primary risk categories: high, medium, and low.

High-level considerations for vulnerabilities span the following key areas when conducting assessments:

*   Malicious Input Handling
*   Escalation of privileges
*   Arithmetic
*   Gas use

Further information regarding the severity criteria referenced throughout the submission review process, please refer to the documentation provided on [the C4 website](https://code423n4.com).

#### [](#impact)Impact

Not every ERC20 token follows OpenZeppelin’s recommendation. It’s possible (inside ERC20 standard) that a `transferFrom` doesn’t revert upon failure but returns `false`.

The code doesn’t check these return values. For example `uToken.transferFrom(msg.sender, o.maker, a);` in `initiateVaultFillingZcTokenInitiate` can be exploited by the msg.sender to initiate a trade without sending any underlying.

#### [](#impact-1)Impact

Taker is charged fees twice in `exitVaultFillingVaultInitiate()` . Maker is transferring less than premiumFilled to taker and then taker is expected to pay fees i.e. taker’s net balance is premiumFilled - 2\*fee

The duplicate of it was at that level by the submitting warden and considering that fees are being incorrectly taken from the taker and not the maker, the maker ends up with a higher balance than expected and the taker has no way to recoup these fees (assets are now lost).

### [](#impact-2)Impact

The function `transferNotionalFrom` of `VaultTracker.sol` uses temporary variables to store the balances. If the “from” and “to” address are the same then the balance of “from” is overwritten by the balance of “to”. This means the balance of “from” and “to” are increased and no balances are decreased, effectively printing money.

Note: `transferNotionalFrom` can be called via `transferVaultNotional` by everyone.

#### [](#proof-of-concept-1)Proof of Concept

      Vault memory from = vaults\[f];
      Vault memory to = vaults\[t];
      ...
      vaults\[f] = from;
      ...
      vaults\[t] = to;    // if f==t then this will overwrite vaults\[f]

#### [](#impact-3)Impact

The solidity function `ecrecover` is used, however the error result of 0 is not checked for. See documentation: [https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.9/units-and-global-variables.html?highlight=ecrecover#mathematical-and-cryptographic-functions](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.9/units-and-global-variables.html?highlight=ecrecover#mathematical-and-cryptographic-functions) “recover the address associated with the public key from elliptic curve signature or return zero on error. ”

Now you can supply invalid input parameters to the `Sig.recover` function, which will then result 0. If you also set `o.maker` to be 0 then this will match and an invalid signature is not detected.

So you can do all kinds of illegal & unexpected transactions.

#### [](#proof-of-concept-2)Proof of Concept

      ...
      require(o.maker == Sig.recover(Hash.message(domain, hash), c), 'invalid signature');
      return hash;

#### [](#impact-4)Impact

Admin role has absolute power across Swivel, Marketplace and VaultTracker contracts with several `onlyOwner` functions. There is no ability to change admin to a new address or renounce it which is helpful for lost/compromised admin keys or to delegate control to a different governance/DAO address in future.

The project does not use the widely used OpenZeppelin Ownable library which provides transfer/renounce functions to mitigate such compromised/accidental situations with admin keys. This makes admin role/key a single-point of failure.

Ensure admins are reasonably redundant/independent (3/7 or 5/9) multisigs and add transfer/renounce functionality for admin. Consider using OpenZeppelin’s Ownable library.

#### [](#impact-5)Impact

`onlyAdmin` functions that change critical contract parameters/addresses/state should emit events and consider adding timelocks so that users and other privileged roles can detect upcoming changes (by offchain monitoring of events) and have the time to react to them.

Privileged functions in all contracts, for e.g. `VaultTracker onlyAdmin`, have direct financial or trust impact on users who should be given an opportunity to react to them by exiting/engaging without being surprised when changes initiated by such functions are made effective opaquely (without events) and/or immediately (without timelocks).

_Submitted by 0xsanson_.

#### [](#impact-7)Impact

The current implementation doesn’t work with fee-on-transfer underlying tokens. Considering that Compound can have these kind of tokens (ex. USDT can activate fees), this issue can affect the protocol.

The problem arises when transferring tokens, basically blocking all functions in `Swivel.sol` for that particular token, since the contract wrongly assumes balances values. This becomes particularly problematic in the following scenario: a market for USDT is running without problems, then they activate the fee: this effectively blocks users from redeeming the underlying.

#### [](#proof-of-concept-6)Proof of Concept

`grep 'transfer' Swivel.sol` for a complete list of affected lines (basically every `tranfer` or `transferFrom` of underlying tokens). Also `grep 'redeemUnderlying' Swivel.sol`.

For example:

      require(CErc20(mPlace.cTokenAddress(u, m)).redeemUnderlying(redeemed) == 0, 'compound redemption failed');
      // transfer underlying back to msg.sender
      Erc20(u).transfer(msg.sender, redeemed);

This would fail (revert) since the contract would have received less than `redeemed` tokens.

#### [](#tools-used-6)Tools Used

editor

#### [](#recommended-mitigation-steps-7)Recommended Mitigation Steps

If the protocol wants to use all possible Compound tokens, a way to handle these tokens must be implemented. A possible way to do it is to check the balance of the contract before and after every time a token is transferred to see the effective quantity. To help keeping the code clear, a function like [Compound’s `doTransferIn`](https://github.com/compound-finance/compound-protocol/blob/master/contracts/CErc20.sol#L156) can be implemented.

#### [](#impact-8)Impact

In `initiateZcTokenFillingZcTokenExit()` , this comment `// transfer underlying tokens - the premium paid + fee in underlying to swivel (from sender)` is incorrect because you are actually transferring the underlying tokens - premium paid to the maker (from sender) AND you have to pay fee separately to swivel.

`initiateZCTokenFillingZcTokenExit` means I want to sell my nTokens so that means `a` is the amount of principal I want to fill. Let’s use a hypothetical example where I (taker) wants to fill 10 units of ZcTokenExit for maker.

1.  I transfer 10 units of underlying to Swivel. The net balances are: me (-a), swivel (+a)
2.  I transfer fee (in underlying) to Swivel. The net balances are: me (-a-fee), swivel (+a+fee)
3.  Swivel initiates my position, sends me the ZcToken and sends Maker the nTokens
4.  Maker pays me premiumFilled for the nTokens. The net balances are: me (-a-fee+premiumsFilled), swivel (+a+fee), maker (-premiumsFilled)
5.  Maker closes position. The net balances are: me (-a-fee+premiumsFilled), swivel (+fee), maker (-premiumsFilled+a)

So effectively, I (taker) should be paying a-premium to maker and fee to swivel.

      filled[hash] += a;
