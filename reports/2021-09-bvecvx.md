[](#about-c4)About C4
---------------------

Code 432n4 (C4) is an open organization consisting of security researchers, auditors, developers, and individuals with domain expertise in smart contracts.

A C4 code contest is an event in which community participants, referred to as Wardens, review, audit, or analyze smart contract logic in exchange for a bounty provided by sponsoring projects.

During the code contest outlined in this document, C4 conducted an analysis of the bveCVX smart contract system written in Solidity. The code contest took place between September 2—September 8 2021.

[](#wardens)Wardens
-------------------

7 Wardens contributed reports to the bveCVX by BadgerDAO code contest:

1.  [cmichel](https://twitter.com/cmichelio)
2.  [tabish](https://twitter.com/tabishjshaikh)
3.  [hickuphh3](https://twitter.com/HickupH)
4.  [pauliax](https://twitter.com/SolidityDev)
5.  [JMukesh](https://twitter.com/MukeshJ_eth)
6.  [pmerkleplant](https://twitter.com/PMerkleplant)
7.  [patitonar](https://twitter.com/patitonar)

This contest was judged by [ghoul.sol](https://twitter.com/ghoulsol).

Final report assembled by [moneylegobatman](https://twitter.com/money_lego) and [CloudEllie](https://twitter.com/CloudEllie1).

[](#summary)Summary
===================

The C4 analysis yielded an aggregated total of 21 unique vulnerabilities and 51 total findings. All of the issues presented here are linked back to their original submission.

Of these findings, 1 received a risk rating in the category of HIGH severity, 2 received a risk rating in the category of MEDIUM severity, and 18 received a risk rating in the category of LOW severity.

C4 analysis also identified 13 non-critical recommendations and 17 gas optimizations.

[](#scope)Scope
===============

The code under review can be found within the [C4 bveCVX code contest repository](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-09-bvecvx) is composed of 219 smart contracts written in the Solidity programming language and includes 21,403 lines of Solidity code.

[](#severity-criteria)Severity Criteria
=======================================

C4 assesses the severity of disclosed vulnerabilities according to a methodology based on [OWASP standards](https://owasp.org/www-community/OWASP_Risk_Rating_Methodology).

Vulnerabilities are divided into three primary risk categories: high, medium, and low.

High-level considerations for vulnerabilities span the following key areas when conducting assessments:

*   Malicious Input Handling
*   Escalation of privileges
*   Arithmetic
*   Gas use

Further information regarding the severity criteria referenced throughout the submission review process, please refer to the documentation provided on [the C4 website](https://code423n4.com).

[](#h-01-vecvxstrategymanualrebalance-has-wrong-logic)[\[H-01\] `veCVXStrategy.manualRebalance` has wrong logic](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-09-bvecvx-findings/issues/47)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

_Submitted by cmichel, also found by tabish_

The `veCVXStrategy.manualRebalance` function computes two ratios `currentLockRatio` and `newLockRatio` and compares them.

However, these ratios compute different things and are not comparable:

*   `currentLockRatio = balanceInLock.mul(10**18).div(totalCVXBalance)` is a **percentage value** with 18 decimals (i.e. `1e18 = 100%`). Its max value can at most be `1e18`.
*   `newLockRatio = totalCVXBalance.mul(toLock).div(MAX_BPS)` is a **CVX token amount**. It’s unbounded and just depends on the `totalCVXBalance` amount.

The comparison that follows does not make sense:

    if (newLockRatio <= currentLockRatio) {
      // ...
    }

#### [](#impact)Impact

The rebalancing is broken and does not correctly rebalance. It usually leads to locking nearly everything if `totalCVXBalance` is high.

#### [](#recommended-mitigation-steps)Recommended Mitigation Steps

Judging from the `cvxToLock = newLockRatio.sub(currentLockRatio)` it seems the desired computation is that the “ratios” should actually be in CVX amounts and not in percentages. Therefore, `currentLockRatio` should just be `balanceInLock`. (The variables should be renamed as they aren’t really ratios but absolute CVX balance amounts.)

[](#medium-risk-findings-2)Medium Risk Findings (2)
===================================================

[](#m-01-settv3transferfrom-block-lock-can-be-circumvented)[\[M-01\] `SettV3.transferFrom` block lock can be circumvented](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-09-bvecvx-findings/issues/49)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

_Submitted by cmichel_

The `SettV3.transferFrom` implements a `_blockLocked` call to prevent users to call several functions at once, for example, `deposit` and then `transfer`ring the tokens.

    function _blockLocked() internal view {
        require(blockLock[msg.sender] < block.number, "blockLocked");
    }

However, as the block lock only checks `msg.sender`, an attacker can circumvent it using `transferFrom`:

*   Attacker owns accounts `A`, `B` and `C`
*   A deposits, `_lockForBlock(msg.sender) = _lockForBlock(A)` is called and `A` is locked.
*   A approves B.
*   B calls `transferFrom(from=A, to=C, amount)`. This passes the `_blockLocked() = _blockLocked(B)` check.
*   C calls `withdraw()`.

#### [](#impact-1)Impact

The protection desired from the `_blockLocked` call does not work for this function. I assume the call is used to prevent flashloan attacks, but an attacker can bypass the protection on `transferFrom`.

#### [](#recommended-mitigation-steps-1)Recommended Mitigation Steps

The block lock should be on the account that holds the tokens, i.e., on `sender` (“from” address), not on `msg.sender`. Parameterize `_blockLocked` to take an account parameter instead.

[](#m-02-cvxlockersetboost-wrong-validation)[\[M-02\] `CvxLocker.setBoost` wrong validation](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-09-bvecvx-findings/issues/51)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

_Submitted by cmichel_

The `CvxLocker.setBoost` function does not validate the `_max, _rate` parameters, instead it validates the already set **storage** variables.

    // @audit this is checking the already-set storage variables, not the parameters
    require(maximumBoostPayment < 1500, "over max payment"); //max 15%
    require(boostRate < 30000, "over max rate"); //max 3x

#### [](#impact-2)Impact

Once wrong boost values are set (which are not validated when they are set), they cannot be set to new values anymore, breaking core contract functionality.

#### [](#recommended-mitigation-steps-2)Recommended Mitigation Steps

Implement these two checks instead:

    require(_max < 1500, "over max payment"); //max 15%
    require(_rate < 30000, "over max rate"); //max 3x

_Submitted by cmichel_

The `CvxLocker.setApprovals` function is callable by anyone, not only by the owner/admin.

#### [](#impact-4)Impact

It’s okay for this function to be callable by anyone.

#### [](#recommended-mitigation-steps-5)Recommended Mitigation Steps

Remove the comment that these are admin-only functions (`ADMIN CONFIGURATION` section) as this is not true for `setApprovals` and one does not know if it’s intended to be admin-only or not.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

_Submitted by cmichel_

It’s unclear why the binary search algorithm stops after `128` iterations.

#### [](#impact-5)Impact

It might not return the actual epoch id (although very unlikely as 128 iterations should be sufficient.)

#### [](#recommended-mitigation-steps-6)Recommended Mitigation Steps

Use a `while (max > min)` loop instead of the `for` loop with a fixed number of iterations.

`uint256 mid = (min + max + 1) / 2;` is also not using safe math.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

_Submitted by cmichel_

The `CvxLocker.updateReward` iterates over all `rewardTokens`.

#### [](#impact-6)Impact

The transactions can fail if the arrays get too big and the transaction would consume more gas than the block limit. This will then result in a denial of service for the desired functionality and break core functionality.

#### [](#recommended-mitigation-steps-7)Recommended Mitigation Steps

Keep the number of `rewardTokens` small.

The contracts are missing slippage checks which can lead to being vulnerable to sandwich attacks.

> A common attack in DeFi is the sandwich attack. Upon observing a trade of asset X for asset Y, an attacker frontruns the victim trade by also buying asset Y, lets the victim execute the trade, and then backruns (executes after) the victim by trading back the amount gained in the first trade. Intuitively, one uses the knowledge that someone’s going to buy an asset, and that this trade will increase its price, to make a profit. The attacker’s plan is to buy this asset cheap, let the victim buy at an increased price, and then sell the received amount again at a higher price afterwards.

See `veCVXStrategy._swapcvxCRVToWant`:

    IUniswapRouterV2(SUSHI_ROUTER).swapExactTokensForTokens(
        toSwap,
        0, // @audit min. return of zero, no slippage check
        path,
        address(this),
        now
    );

#### [](#impact-7)Impact

Trades can happen at a bad price and lead to receiving fewer tokens than at a fair market price. The attacker’s profit is the protocol’s loss.

#### [](#recommended-mitigation-steps-8)Recommended Mitigation Steps

Add minimum return amount checks.

Accept a function parameter that can be chosen by the transaction sender, then check that the actually received amount is above this parameter.

Alternatively, check if it’s feasible to send these transactions directly to a miner such that they are not visible in the public mempool.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

_Submitted by hickuphh3_

##### [](#impact-10)Impact

In `veCVXStrategy`, the `cvxCRV -> ETH -> CVX` conversion via sushiswap is done with 0 `minAmountOut`, making it susceptible to sandwich attacks / MEV flashbots. This is also true for `UniSwapper` inherited by `StrategyCvxHelper`.

##### [](#recommended-mitigation-steps-12)Recommended Mitigation Steps

1.  `veCVXStrategy`
    
    Ideally, the `harvest()` function should take in a `minAmountOut` parameter, but this breaks the Yearn architecture used. Using TWAPs / price oracles might alleviate the problem, but results in higher gas usage, and with multiple hops involved, may not be feasible.
    
    A simpler approach would be to have a configurable storage variable `minAmountOut`. Its value can then be adjusted such that harvesting can be done infrequently to save gas.

    Ideally, each path registered in the `TokenSwapPathRegistry` should also have a `minAmount` mapping, that can be fetched together with the path.

`_swapcvxCRVToWant()` swaps `cvxCRV -> ETH -> CVX` via sushiswap.

Looking at sushiswap analytics, this may also not be the most optimal trading path. The cvxCRV-CRV pool seems to have substantially better liquidity than the cvxCRV-ETH pool as reported [here](https://www.notion.so/6a2dc64a1969e19c23e4f579f9810aa7) (Note that cvxCRV-CRV’s liquidity is overstated, [clicking into the pool](https://www.notion.so/a2a8a54062e021873bcaee006cdf4007) gives a more reasonable amount). It is therefore better to do `cvxCRV -> CRV -> ETH -> CVX`, though this comes at the cost of higher gas usage.

##### [](#recommended-mitigation-steps-13)Recommended Mitigation Steps

Switch the trading path to `cvxCRV -> CRV -> ETH -> CVX`, as it means more CVX tokens received, translating to higher APY, while the higher gas cost is borne by the caller.

Additionally, given how liquidity can shift between pools over time, the most optimal trade path may change accordingly. Hence, it may be beneficial to make the pool path configurable.

function `withdrawAll` in `BaseStrategy` declares ‘returns (uint256 balance)’, however, no actual value is returned. function reinvest in `MyStrategy` declares to return ‘uint256 reinvested’, however, it also actually does not return anything so they always get assigned a default value of 0.

#### [](#recommended-mitigation-steps-14)Recommended Mitigation Steps

Either remove the return declarations or return the intended values. Otherwise, it may confuse other protocols that later may want to integrate with you.

#### [](#impact-13)Impact

`distribute` and `distributeOther` can be frontrunned. Anyone can call these functions and receive `callIncentive`. A frontrunner can watch the mempool and copy the calldata to replicate the same tx. For example, a frontrunner calculates that replicating this tx will result in profit, he watches and copies the tx, then instantly sell these received incentives on AMM for profit. This may result in reverted txs, gas wasted, and a poor experience for legit users.

#### [](#recommended-mitigation-steps-15)Recommended Mitigation Steps

This problem seems insurmountable in this case but you may want to consider adding restrictions on the callers or introducing any other possible prevention techniques.

The function `reinvest` in the veCVXStrategy always returns 0 as the return variable `reinvested` is never updated. The function is `onlyGovernance` and the return value probably does not matter if the caller is a multi-sig. However, if a protocol is set as `onlyGovernance` the faulty return value would have to be ignored by the caller to not transition into an incorrect state.

#### [](#proof-of-concept-1)Proof of Concept

The variable `reinvested` is declared as return variable ([line 400](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-09-bvecvx/blob/32ecfd005d421f29c3846f4609fec33eaad388b9/veCVX/contracts/veCVXStrategy.sol#L400)) but not updated to reflect the actual amount reinvested which is saved in variable `toDeposit`.

Therefore always the default value is returned (0).

#### [](#recommended-mitigation-steps-16)Recommended Mitigation Steps

Add `reinvested = toDeposit;` after line 412.

The `distribute` function can be re-entered by fake tokens or tokens with callbacks. An attacker can use the callbacks on `safeTransfer` if a token has a callback to reenter an drain the entire balance of that particular token before the `notifyRewardAmount` is called.

I think this is only a medium issue because the attacker can only take tokens with callbacks, and I don’t think any of the tokens you guys use have callbacks.

We have previously seen that the `harvest` function can be exploited for almost all the tokens at stake. Since `ManualRebalance` calls `harvest`, it is also unsafe and funds swapped using it will likely be lost.

Adding an amount out minimum here will work that should be passed on to the `harvest` method.
