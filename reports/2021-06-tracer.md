[](#about-c4)About C4
---------------------

Code 432n4 (C4) is an open organization consisting of security researchers, auditors, developers, and individuals with domain expertise in smart contracts.

A C4 code contest is an event in which community participants, referred to as Wardens, review, audit, or analyze smart contract logic in exchange for a bounty provided by sponsoring projects.

During the code contest outlined in this document, C4 conducted an analysis of the Tracer smart contract system written in Solidity. The code contest took place between June 23—June 30, 2021.

In the `Pricing` contract, an agent can manipulate the trading prices by spamming a high amount of trades.

Indeed an agent can create a high amount of orders at an arbitrary price and with a near-zero amount (so the agent doesn’t even need large funds); next he/she pairs the orders with another account and calls `Trader.executeTrade`; now every order calls a `Pricing.recordTrade` using the arbitrary price set by the agent.

Since the trades are all made in the same hour, by the way `hourlyTracerPrices[currentHour]` is calculated, it skews the average price towards the price set by the agent. This arbitrary value is used to calculate the `fundingRates` and the `fairPrice`, allowing a malicious agent the ability to manipulate the market.

Recommend passing the `fillAmount` parameter to `recordTrade(...)`, and calculate `hourlyTracerPrices[currentHour].trades` summing `fillAmount` instead of 1 every trade.

> Issue is valid, and there appear to be a few other issues that reference similar problems.
> 
> The Trader contract will have a whitelist allowing only select relayers to push orders on chain. As long as off chain order books have sufficient liquidity, this issue is then mitigated as users can’t just arbitrarily match orders and send them in, they must be matched on a book with liquidity. To alter the price you would then need to eat through significant liquidity (increasing the cost of this attack).

The `updateFundingRate()` function updates the funding rate and insurance funding rate. While the instant/new funding rates are calculated correctly, the cumulative funding rate calculation is incorrect because it is always adding the instant to 0, not the previous value. This is due to the use of `[currentFundingIndex]` which has been updated since the previous call to this function while it should really be using `[currentFundingIndex-1]` to reference the previous funding rate.

The impact of this, is that the cumulative funding rate and insurance funding rates are calculated incorrectly without considering the correct previous values. This affects the settling of accounts across the entire protocol. The protocol logic is significantly impacted, accounts will not be settled as expected, protocol shutdown and contracts will need to be redeployed. Users may lose funds and the protocol takes a reputation hit.

Recommend using `[currentFundingIndex-1]` for non-zero values of `currentFundingIndex` to get the value updated in the previous call on lines L155 and L159 of `Pricing.sol`.

The `withdrawERC20Token()` in `SafetyWithdraw` inherited in `TracerPerpetualSwaps` is presumably a guarded launch emergency withdrawal mechanism. However, given the trust model where the market creator/owner is potentially untrusted/malicious, this is a dangerous approach to emergency withdrawal in the context of guarded launch.

Alternatively, if this is meant for the owner to withdraw “external” ERC20 tokens mistakenly deposited to the Tracer market, then the function should exclude `tracerQuoteToken` from being the `tokenAddress` that can be used as a parameter to `withdrawERC20Token()`.

The impact of this is that, if a malicious owner of a market withdraws/rugs all `tracerQuoteToken`s deposited at any time after market launch, all users lose deposits and the protocol takes a reputational hit and has to refund the users from treasury.

Therefor, it is recommended that, for a guarded launch circuit breaker, design a pause/unpause feature where deposits are paused (in emergency situations) but withdrawals are allowed by the depositors themselves instead of the owner. Alternatively, if this is meant to be for removing external ERC20 tokens accidentally deposited to market, exclude the `tracerQuoteToken` from being given as the `tokenAddress`.

**[raymogg (Tracer) confirmed but suggested a severity of 2](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-06-tracer-findings/issues/81#issuecomment-873752133) :**

> The only reason for the dispute on severity is that as part of the security model, the owner can manipulate the market in other ways (such as changing the oracle being used), so this trust assumption over the owner already exists. For this reason the team thinks this issue is closer to a medium
> 
> This however is a good issue as it is not the greatest circuit breaking mechanism, and as noted in #7 can reflect badly on the project without the exploit being used. The mechanism is being removed and replaced with more structured circuit breaker.

**[cemozerr (Judge) commented](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-06-tracer-findings/issues/81#issuecomment-882110087):**

> Marking this as high risk, as regardless of the owner manipulating in other ways, the threat persists.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In `LibBalances.applyTrade()`, we need to collect a fee from the trade. However, the current code subtracts a fee from the short position and adds it to the long. The correct implementation is to subtract a fee to both (see `TracerPerpetualSwaps.sol` L272). This issue causes withdrawals problems, since Tracer thinks it can withdraw the collect fees, leaving the users with an incorrect amount of quote tokens.

Recommend changing `+fee` to `-fee` in the [highlighted line](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-06-tracer/blob/main/src/contracts/lib/LibBalances.sol#L187).

The `Liquidation` contract allows the liquidator to submit “bad” trade orders and the insurance reimburses them from the insurance fund, see `Liquidation.claimReceipt`. The function can be called with an `orders` array, which does not check for duplicate orders. An attacker can abuse this to make a profit by liquidating themselves, making a small bad trade and repeatedly submitting this bad trade for slippage reimbursement.

**Example**:

*   Attacker uses two accounts, one as the liquidator and one as the liquidatee.
*   They run some high-leverage trades such that the liquidatee gets liquidated with the next price update. (If not cash out and make a profit this way through trading, and try again.)
*   Liquidator liquidates liquidatee
*   They now do two trades:
    
    *   One “good” trade at the market price that fills 99% of the liquidation amount. The slippage protection should not kick in for this trade
    *   One “bad” trade at a horrible market price that fills only 1% of the liquidation amount. This way the slippage protection kicks in for this trade
*   The liquidator now calls `claimReceipt(orders)` where `orders` is an array that contains many duplicates of the “bad” trade, for example 100 times. The `calcUnitsSold` function will return `unitsSold = receipt.amountLiquidated` and a bad `avgPrice`. They are now reimbursed the price difference on the full liquidation amount (instead of only on 1% of it) making an overall profit

This can be repeated until the insurance fund is drained.

The attacker has an incentive to do this attack as it’s profitable and the insurance fund will be completely drained.

Recommend disallowing duplicate orders in the `orders` argument of `claimReceipt`. This should make the attack at least unprofitable, but it could still be a griefing attack. A quick way to ensure that `orders` does not contain duplicates is by having liquidators submit the orders in a sorted way (by order ID) and then checking in the `calcUnitsSold` `for` loop that the current order ID is strictly greater than the previous one.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

_Submitted by cmichel_

The `GasOracle` uses two chainlink oracles (GAS in ETH with some decimals, USD per ETH with some decimals) and multiplies their raw return values to get the gas price in USD.

However, the scaling depends on the underlying decimals of the two oracles and could be anything. But the code assumes it’s in 18 decimals.

> “Returned value is USD/Gas \* 10^18 for compatibility with rest of calculations”

There is a `toWad` function that seems to involve scaling but it is never used.

The impact is that, If the scale is wrong, the gas price can be heavily inflated or under-reported.

Recommend checking `chainlink.decimals()` to know the decimals of the oracle answers and scale the answers to 18 decimals such that no matter the decimals of the underlying oracles, the `latestAnswer` function always returns the answer in 18 decimals.

The contracts use Chainlink’s deprecated API `latestAnswer()`. Such functions might suddenly stop working if Chainlink stopped supporting deprecated APIs.

The impact is that, if the deprecated API stops working, prices cannot be obtained, the protocol stops and contracts have to be redeployed.

Recommend using V3 [interface functions](https://docs.chain.link/docs/price-feeds-api-reference/).

The smart contract doesn’t check the return value of `token.transfer()` and `token.transferFrom()`, some erc20 token might not revert in case of error but return false. In the [TracerPerpetualSwaps:deposit](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-06-tracer/blob/main/src/contracts/TracerPerpetualSwaps.sol#L151) and [Insurance:deposit](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-06-tracer/blob/main/src/contracts/Insurance.sol#L51) this would allow a user to deposit for free. See issue page for other places.

Recommend wrapping the call into a `require()` or using openzeppelin’s [SafeERC20 library](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC20/utils/SafeERC20.sol).

There are ERC20 tokens that may make certain customizations to their ERC20 contracts. One type of these tokens is deflationary tokens that charge a certain fee for every `transfer()` or `transferFrom()`.

The `deposit()` functions of `Insurance` and `TracerPerpetualSwaps` assume that the external ERC20 balance of the contract increases by the same amount as the `amount` parameter of the `transferFrom`.

The user is credited the full amount without the taxes (`userBalance.position.quote`).

Recommend as one possible mitigation, measuring the asset change right before and after the asset-transferring functions.

The contracts assume that all tokens will have <=18 decimals. This isn’t necessarily a problem if the Tracer team is the only people deploying the contracts and they keep it in mind. But, If the contracts are to be deployed by other people, this assumption should be made explicit and hard-coded.

We can see that the scaler computations will underflow and be defined when it should not be In [L220-L232](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-06-tracer/blob/main/src/contracts/lib/LibBalances.sol#L220-L232).

Recommend writing a require check that ensures `tokenDecimals <= 18` before running the above functions.

As written in the to-do comments, reentrancy could happen in the `executeTrade` function of `Trader` since the `makeOrder.market` can be a user-controlled external contract. See [L121-L126](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-06-tracer/blob/main/src/contracts/Trader.sol#L121-L126) in `Trader.sol`.

Recommend adding a reentrancy guard (e.g., the [implementation from OpenZeppelin](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/security/ReentrancyGuard.sol)) to prevent the users from reentering critical functions.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

_Submitted by 0xRajeev_

The `Tracer Perpetuals Factory` contract is arguably the most critical contract in the project given that it deploys all the markets. The ownership of this contract is transferred to `_governance address`, i.e. TracerDAO, in the constructor. This critical address transfer in one-step is very risky because it is irrecoverable from any mistakes.

The impact is that, if an incorrect address (e.g. one for which the private key is not known) is used accidentally, then it prevents the use of all the `onlyOwner()` functions forever, which includes the changing of various deployer contract addresses and market approvals. This use of an incorrect address may not even be immediately apparent given that these functions are probably not used immediately. When noticed, due to a failing `onlyOwner()` function call, it will force the redeployment of the `factory` contract and require appropriate changes and notifications for switching from the old to new address. This will diminish trust in markets and incur a significant reputational damage. See [issue page](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-06-tracer-findings/issues/43) for proof of concept.

Recommend retaining the deployer ownership in the constructor and then using a two-step address change to `_governance` address separately using setter functions:

1.  Approve a new address as a `pendingOwner`
2.  A transaction from the `pendingOwner` (TracerDAO) address claims the pending ownership change.

This mitigates risk because if an incorrect address is used in step (1), then it can be fixed by re-approving the correct address. Only after a correct address is used in step (1) can step (2) happen and complete the address/ownership change.

_Submitted by 0xRajeev_

The Tracer protocol like any other allows market creators to charge fees for trades. However, a malicious/greedy owner can arbitrarily change fee to any % value and without an event to observe this change or a timelock to react, there is no easy way for users to monitor this via front-end or off-chain monitoring tools.

The impact is that, if the users are trading on a market with 0.1% fees and the owner suddenly changes this to 100%, the users realise this only after their trades are executed. Market loses confidence. Protocol takes a reputational hit.

See similar Medium-severity finding in [ConsenSys’s Audit of 1inch Liquidity Protocol](https://consensys.net/diligence/audits/2020/12/1inch-liquidity-protocol/#unpredictable-behavior-for-users-due-to-admin-front-running-or-general-bad-timing)

Recommend implementing an `Emit` event, and providing a timelock for users to react and establish an upper threshold for fees that is decided across markets by governance.

The owner of `TracerPerpetualSwaps` contract, who is potentially untrusted as per specification, can change the market critical parameters such as the addresses of the `Liquidation`/`Pricing`/`Insurance`/`GasOracle`/`FeeReceiver` and also critical values such as `feeRate`, `maxLeverage`, `fundingRateSensitivity`, `deleveragingCliff`, `lowestMaxLeverage`, `insurancePoolSwitchStage` and whitelisting.

None of these setter functions emit events to record these changes on-chain for off-chain monitors/tools/interfaces to register the updates and react if necessary.

The impact of this is that, if a malicious owner changes the critical addresses or values that significantly change the security posture/perception of the protocol. No events are emitted and users lose funds/confidence. The protocol takes a reputation hit.

See similar high-severity finding in [OpenZeppelin’s Audit of Audius](https://blog.openzeppelin.com/audius-contracts-audit/#high) and medium-severity finding [OpenZeppelin’s Audit of UMA Phase 4](https://blog.openzeppelin.com/uma-audit-phase-4/).

Recommend to consider emitting events when these addresses/values are updated. This will be more transparent and it will make it easier to keep track of the status of the system.

The `TracerPerpetualSwaps.settle` function updates the user’s last index to `currentGlobalFundingIndex`, however a comment states:

> ”// Note: global rates reference the last fully established rate (hence the -1), and not the current global rate. User rates reference the last saved user rate”

The code for the `else` branch also updates the last index to `currentGlobalFundingIndex - 1` instead of `currentGlobalFundingIndex`.

    if (accountBalance.position.base == 0) {
        // set to the last fully established index
        // @audit shouldn't this be global - 1 like below?
        accountBalance.lastUpdatedIndex = currentGlobalFundingIndex;
        accountBalance.lastUpdatedGasPrice = IOracle(gasPriceOracle).latestAnswer();
    }

The impact is that it might be possible for first-time depositors to skip having to pay the first funding rate period as the `accountLastUpdatedIndex + 1 < currentGlobalFundingIndex` check will still return `false` when the funding rates are updated the next time.

Recommend to check if setting it to `currentGlobalFundingIndex` or to `currentGlobalFundingIndex - 1` is correct.

A liquidator can always claim the liquidation escrow in the following way:

*   create a second account
*   setup a complimentary trade in that second account, which will result in a large slippage when executed
*   call `executeTrade` (which everyone can call), to execute a trade between his own two accounts with a large slippage
*   the slippage doesn’t hurt because the liquidator owns both accounts
*   call `claimReceipt` with the receiptId of the executed order, within the required period (e.g. 15 minutes)

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

_Submitted by gpersoon_

It’s possible to avoid paying insurance in the following way:

*   once per hour (at the right moment), do the following:
*   using a flash loan, or with a large amount of tokens, call `deposit` of `Insurance.sol` to make sure that the pool is sufficiently filled (`poolHoldings` > `poolTarget`)
*   call the function `executeTrade` of Trader`.sol` with a minimal trade (possibly of value 0, see finding ”`executeTrade` with same trades”)
*   `executeTrade` calls `matchOrders`, which calls `recordTrade`
*   `recordTrade` calls `updateFundingRate()`; (once per hour, so you have to be sure you do it in time before other trades trigger this)
*   `updateFundingRate` calls `getPoolFundingRate`
*   `getPoolFundingRate` determines the insurance rate, but because the insurance pool is sufficiently full (due to the flash loan), the rate is 0
*   `updateFundingRate` stores the 0 rate via `setInsuranceFundingRate` (which is used later on to calculate the amounts for the insurances)
*   withdraw from the Insurance and pay back the flash loan

The insurance rates are 0 now and no-one pays insurance. The gas costs relative to the insurance costs + the flash loan fees determine if this is an economically viable attack. Otherwise it is still a grief attack. This will probably be detected pretty soon because the insurance pool will stay empty. However its difficult to prevent.

See issue page for code referenced in proof of concept.

Recommend setting a timelock on withdrawing insurance.

The `Trader` contract accepts two signed orders and tries to match them. Once they are matched and become filled, they can therefore not be matched against other orders anymore.

This allows for a griefing attack where an attacker can deny any other user from trading by observing the mempool and front-running their trades by creating their own order and match it against the counter order instead.

In this way, a trader can be denied from trading. The cost of the griefing attack is that the trader has to match the order themselves, however depending on the liquidity of the order book and the spread, they might be able to do the counter-trade again afterwards, basically just paying the fees.

It could be useful if the attacker is a liquidator and is stopping a user who is close to liquidation from becoming liquid again.

This seems hard to circumvent in the current design. If the order book is also off-chain, the `executeTrade` could also be a bot-only function.

Zero-address checks are a best-practice for input validation of critical address parameters. While the codebase applies this to most addresses in setters, there are many places where this is missing in constructors and setters. Accidental use of zero-addresses may result in exceptions, burn fees/tokens or force redeployment of contracts.

Recommend adding zero-address checks.

There are several setter functions that do not check if the amount is less than 100% including:

The gas cost for liquidation may change if code is updated/optimized, the compiler is changed or profiling is improved. The developers may forget to update this constant in code. The impact is that the margin validity calculation, which uses this value, may be affected if this changes and hence is not as declared in the constant. This may adversely impact validation.

Because It is safer to make this a constructor-set immutable value that will force usage of an updated accurate value at deployment time.

Recommend evaluating if the sensitivity to this value is great enough to justify a setter to change it if incorrectly initialized at deployment.

_Submitted by 0xRajeev_

The `Deposit` event uses the function parameter amount instead of the `convertedWadAmount` which is what is used to update the user’s position and TVL because it prevents any dust deposited in amount. This will also make it consistent with the emit event in the `withdraw` function.

The impact is that the`Deposit` event amount reflects the value with dust while the user position does not. This may lead to confusion.

Recommend using `uint256(convertedWadAmount)` instead of amount in `Deposit` event.

_Submitted by 0xRajeev_

The TVL calculation in `deposit()` uses `convertedWadAmount` but the one in `withdraw()` uses the parameter `amount`. While `amount` is still in WAD format, it may contain dust which is what the conversion to `rawTokenAmount` and then back to `convertedWadAmount` removes.

The impact of this is that use of `amount` in TVL during `withdraw()` will consider dust while the one in `deposit()` will not, which is inconsistent.

Recommend using `convertedWadAmount` instead of `amount` to be consistent with the increment during `withdraw()` TVL calculation.

Low-level calls `call`/`delegatecall`/`staticcall` return true even if the account called is non-existent (per EVM design).

Solidity documentation warns:

> “The low-level functions `call`, `delegatecall` and `staticcall` return true as their first return value if the account called is non-existent, as part of the design of the EVM. Account existence must be checked prior to calling if needed.”

Market address may not exist as a contract (e.g. incorrect EOA address used in orders), in which case low-level calls still returns true/success. But the trade is assumed to have been successfully executed.

As a result, `executeTrade()` executes batch orders against a non-existing market contract due to a mistake in the trading interface. The transaction executes successfully without any side-effects because the market doesn’t exist. Internal accounting is updated incorrectly.

_Submitted by 0xRajeev_

In `verifyAndSubmitLiquidation()`, the `tx.gasprice` is checked against the `fastGasOracle`’s current gas price presumably to prevent liquidators front-running others for the same market/account by using a gas price exceeding the current prevailing price as indicated by the `fastGasOracle`.

The impact is that, if the gas prices are increasing rapidly due to volatility or network congestion, or if the liquidation engines and `fastGasOracle` are out of sync on gas prices because of consulting different sources, then these liquidations will keep failing. Front-running risk on liquidations is not adequately protected by `tx.gasprice` check.

This logic may also be impacted by the upcoming inclusion of EIP-1559 in London fork which affect gas semantics significantly.

Liquidation bots front-running by monitoring mempool or the use of FlashBots for liquidation MEV, is a systemic challenge and not solved by using gasprice logic in contracts. Would recommend evaluating if the benefits match the failure modes.

If you call the function `withdrawFees` when “TVL” is not enough for the fee, then the code would revert. In this case the fees cannot be withdrawn. Although it is unlikely that the TVL would be wrong, it is probably better to be able to withdraw the remaining fees.

`TracerPerpetualSwaps.sol` [L508](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-06-tracer/blob/main/src/contracts/TracerPerpetualSwaps.sol#L508)

    function withdrawFees() external override {
        uint256 tempFees = fees;
        fees = 0;
        tvl = tvl - tempFees;
    
        // Withdraw from the account
        IERC20(tracerQuoteToken).transfer(feeReceiver, tempFees);
        emit FeeWithdrawn(feeReceiver, tempFees);
    }

Recommend adding something like `tempFees = min (fees, tvl);`, and changing `fees=0` to `fees -= tempFees;`

The function `matchOrders` of `TracerPerpetualSwaps.sol` doesn’t check that the contract itself is indeed equal to `order1.market` and `order2.market`.

The function `executeTrade` in `Trader.sol`, which calls the `matchOrders`, can deal with multiple markets.

Suppose there would be a mistake in `executeTrade`, or in a future version, the `matchOrders` would be done in the wrong market.

`TracerPerpetualSwaps.sol` [L216](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-06-tracer/blob/main/src/contracts/TracerPerpetualSwaps.sol#L216)

    function `matchOrders`( Perpetuals.Order memory order1, Perpetuals.Order memory order2, uint256 fillAmount )

`Trader.sol` [L67](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-06-tracer/blob/main/src/contracts/Trader.sol#L67)

     function `executeTrade`(Types.SignedLimitOrder[] memory makers, Types.SignedLimitOrder[] memory takers) external  override {
    ...
        (bool success, ) = makeOrder.market.call(
        abi.encodePacked(
            ITracerPerpetualSwaps(makeOrder.market).matchOrders.selector,
            abi.encode(makeOrder, takeOrder, fillAmount)
        )
    );

`LibPerpetuals.sol` [L128](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-06-tracer/blob/main/src/contracts/lib/LibPerpetuals.sol#L128)

        ...
            bool marketsMatch = a.market == b.market;

Recommend adding something like:

    require ( order1.market == address(this), "Wrong market");

Note: `canMatch` already verifies that `order1.market== order2.market`

Hardcoding `chainID` is error-prone (in case you decide to deploy on a different chain and forget to change this, or if the chain forks, etc…): `uint256 public constant override chainId = 1337;` // Changes per chain

Recommend better utilization of global variable `block.chainid`, or you can also retrieve `chainID` via [assembly](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/a/77550/17387).

The `getHourlyAvgTracerPrice` and `getHourlyAvgOraclePrice` functions in `Pricing` return 0 if there is no trade during the given `hour` because of the design of `averagePrice`, which could mislead users that the hourly average price is 0. The same problem happens when emitting the old hourly average in the `recordTrade` function. See `Pricing.sol` [L254-L256](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-06-tracer/blob/main/src/contracts/Pricing.sol#L254-L256), [L262-L264](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-06-tracer/blob/main/src/contracts/Pricing.sol#L262-L264), and [L74](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-06-tracer/blob/main/src/contracts/Pricing.sol#L74).

Recommend returning a special value (e.g., `type(uint256).max`) from `averagePrice` if there is no trade during the specified hour to distinguish from an actual zero price. Handle this particular value whenever the `averagePrice` function is called by others.

The `leveragedNotionalValue` function of `LibBalance` gets the margin value of a position (i.e., the `marginValue` variable) to calculate the notional value. However, the position’s margin value is not checked to be non-negative. Margin with a value less than zero is considered invalid and should be specially handled. [L80](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-06-tracer/blob/main/src/contracts/lib/LibBalances.sol#L80) in `LibBalances.sol`.

Recommend checking whether `marginValue` is less than zero and handle this case.

_Submitted by shw_

The `recordTrade` function in `Pricing` updates the `currentHour` variable by 1 every hour. However, if there is no trade (i.e., the `recordTrade` is not called) during this hour, the `currentHour` is out of sync with the actual hour. As a result, the `averagePriceForPeriod` function uses the prices before 24 hours and causes errors on the average price. See `Pricing.sol` [L90-L94](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-06-tracer/blob/main/src/contracts/Pricing.sol#L90-L94).

Recommend calculating how much time passed (e.g., `(block.timestamp - startLastHour) / 3600`) to update the `currentHour` variable correctly.

Trading function `executeTrade()` batch executes maker/taker orders against a market. The trader/interface provides arrays of makers/takers which is unbounded. As a result, if the number of orders is too many, there is a risk of this transaction exceeding the block gas limit (which is 15 million currently). See `Trader.sol` [L67](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-06-tracer/blob/74e720ee100fd027c592ea44f272231ad4dfa2ab/src/contracts/Trader.sol#L67) and [L78](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-06-tracer/blob/74e720ee100fd027c592ea44f272231ad4dfa2ab/src/contracts/Trader.sol#L78)

The impact is that if `executeTrade()` is called with too many orders in the batch, the transaction might exceed block gas limit and revert, resulting in none of the orders are executed.

See similar medium-severity finding from [ConsenSys’s Audit of Growth DeFi](https://consensys.net/diligence/audits/2020/12/growth-defi-v1/#potential-resource-exhaustion-by-external-calls-performed-within-an-unbounded-loop).

Recommend limiting the number or orders executed based on `gasleft()` after every iteration, or estimating the gas cost and enforcing an upper bound on the number of orders allowed in maker/taker arrays.

These array memory parameters can be problematic if not used properly.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

_Submitted by cmichel_

The pool holdings of `Insurance` (`publicCollateralAmount` and `bufferCollateralAmount`) is in WAD (18 decimals) but it’s used as a raw token value in `drainPool`

    // amount is a mix of pool holdings, i.e., 18 decimals
    // this requires amount to be in RAW! if tracerMarginToken has > 18 decimals, it'll break, < 18 decimals will approve too much
    tracerMarginToken.approve(address(tracer), amount);
    // this requires amount to be in WAD which is correct
    tracer.deposit(amount);

If `tracerMarginToken` has less than 18 decimals, the approval approves orders of magnitude more tokens than required for the `deposit` call that follows. If `tracerMarginToken` has more than 18 decimals, the `deposit` that follows would fail as fewer tokens were approved, but the protocol seems to disallow tokens in general with more than 18 decimals.

Recommend converting the `amount` to a “raw token value” and approve this one instead.

> It is common practice to approve the maximum amount of tokens for a contract to spend already. This bug simply allows more tokens to be approved (to a trusted contract in the system), than was intended. This is only exploitable if paired with another bug in the Tracer contracts. As is, no users would be affected.
