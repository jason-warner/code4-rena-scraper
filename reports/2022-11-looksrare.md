[](#about-c4)About C4
---------------------

Code4rena (C4) is an open organization consisting of security researchers, auditors, developers, and individuals with domain expertise in smart contracts.

A C4 audit contest is an event in which community participants, referred to as Wardens, review, audit, or analyze smart contract logic in exchange for a bounty provided by sponsoring projects.

During the audit contest outlined in this document, C4 conducted an analysis of the LooksRare Aggregator smart contract system written in Solidity. The audit contest took place between November 8—November 13 2022.

This contest was judged by [Picodes](https://twitter.com/thePicodes).

Final report assembled by [itsmetechjay](https://twitter.com/itsmetechjay).

[](#summary)Summary
===================

The C4 analysis yielded an aggregated total of 6 unique vulnerabilities. Of these vulnerabilities, 0 received a risk rating in the category of HIGH severity and 6 received a risk rating in the category of MEDIUM severity.

Additionally, C4 analysis included 54 reports detailing issues with a risk rating of LOW severity or non-critical. There were also 12 reports recommending gas optimizations.

All of the issues presented here are linked back to their original finding.

[](#scope)Scope
===============

The code under review can be found within the [C4 LooksRare Aggregator contest repository](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-11-looksrare), and is composed of 26 smart contracts written in the Solidity programming language and includes 1,230 lines of Solidity code.

[](#severity-criteria)Severity Criteria
=======================================

C4 assesses the severity of disclosed vulnerabilities based on three primary risk categories: high, medium, and low/non-critical.

High-level considerations for vulnerabilities span the following key areas when conducting assessments:

*   Malicious Input Handling
*   Escalation of privileges
*   Arithmetic
*   Gas use

For more information regarding the severity criteria referenced throughout the submission review process, please refer to the documentation provided on [the C4 website](https://code4rena.com), specifically our section on [Severity Categorization](https://docs.code4rena.com/awarding/judging-criteria/severity-categorization).

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

_Submitted by [KingNFT](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-11-looksrare-findings/issues/54)_

The `\_executeNonAtomicOrders` function in SeaportProxy.sol tries to send fees by batch. This may break the `NonAtomic` feature.

### [](#proof-of-concept)Proof of Concept

Let’s say the user wants to buy 3 NFTs with the following order parameters:

    NFT_1: price = 100 USDT, fee = 5%
    NFT_2: price = 200 USDT, fee = 5%
    NFT_3: price = 300 USDT, fee = 5%

Given the user only sends 600 USDT, the expected result should be

    NFT_1: success
    NFT_2: success
    NFT_3: failed

But as the fees are batched and sent at last, cause all 3 orders failed.

    function _executeNonAtomicOrders(
        BasicOrder[] calldata orders,
        bytes[] calldata ordersExtraData,
        address recipient,
        uint256 feeBp,
        address feeRecipient
    ) private {
        uint256 fee;
        address lastOrderCurrency;
        for (uint256 i; i < orders.length; ) {
            OrderExtraData memory orderExtraData = abi.decode(ordersExtraData[i], (OrderExtraData));
            AdvancedOrder memory advancedOrder;
            advancedOrder.parameters = _populateParameters(orders[i], orderExtraData);
            advancedOrder.numerator = orderExtraData.numerator;
            advancedOrder.denominator = orderExtraData.denominator;
            advancedOrder.signature = orders[i].signature;
    
            address currency = orders[i].currency;
            uint256 price = orders[i].price;
    
            try
                marketplace.fulfillAdvancedOrder{value: currency == address(0) ? price : 0}(
                    advancedOrder,
                    new CriteriaResolver[](0),
                    bytes32(0),
                    recipient
                )
            {
                if (feeRecipient != address(0)) {
                    uint256 orderFee = (price * feeBp) / 10000;
                    if (currency == lastOrderCurrency) {
                        fee += orderFee;
                    } else {
                        if (fee > 0) _transferFee(fee, lastOrderCurrency, feeRecipient);
    
                        lastOrderCurrency = currency;
                        fee = orderFee;
                    }
                }
            } catch {}
    
            unchecked {
                ++i;
            }
        }

[](#m-02-too-much-fee-charged-when-seaport-is-partially-filled)[\[M-02\] Too much fee charged when Seaport is partially filled](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-11-looksrare-findings/issues/71)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

_Submitted by [cccz](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-11-looksrare-findings/issues/71)_

When a user fulfills an order using SeaportProxy, fees are charged in the `\_handleFees` function based on orders.price.

        function _handleFees(
            BasicOrder[] calldata orders,
            uint256 feeBp,
            address feeRecipient
        ) private {
            address lastOrderCurrency;
            uint256 fee;
            uint256 ordersLength = orders.length;
    
            for (uint256 i; i < ordersLength; ) {
                address currency = orders[i].currency;
                uint256 orderFee = (orders[i].price * feeBp) / 10000;

According to the Seaport documentation, Seaport allows partial fulfillment of orders, which results in too much fee being charged when an order is partially filled [https://docs.opensea.io/v2.0/reference/seaport-overview#partial-fills](https://docs.opensea.io/v2.0/reference/seaport-overview#partial-fills)

Consider feeBp == 2%

The order on Seaport has a fill status of 0/100 and each item is worth 1 eth. User A fulfills the order using LooksRareAggregator.execute and sends 102 ETH, where order.price == 100 ETH.

Since the other user fulfilled the order before User A, when User A fulfills the order, the order status is 99/100.

Eventually User A buys an item for 1 ETH but pays a fee of 2 ETH.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

_Submitted by [0xSmartContract](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-11-looksrare-findings/issues/127), also found by [carrotsmuggler](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-11-looksrare-findings/issues/191)_

It is stated in the documents that “contract ownership management” is used with a timelock;

    README.md:
      122: - Does it use a timelock function?: Yes but only for contract ownership management and not business critical functions.

However, the `function _setupDelayForRenouncingOwnership` where timelock is specified in the `OwnableTwoSteps.sol` contract where `owner` privileges are set is not used in the project, so a timelock cannot be mentioned.

     function _setupDelayForRenouncingOwnership(uint256 _delay) internal {
            delay = _delay;
        }

This is stated in the NatSpec comments but there is no definition as stated in the comments;

    contracts/OwnableTwoSteps.sol:
      40:      *         Delay (for the timelock) must be set by the contract that inherits from this.

### [](#recommended-mitigation-steps-2)Recommended Mitigation Steps

    contracts/OwnableTwoSteps.sol:
    
        // Delay for the timelock (in seconds)
        uint256 public delay;

### [](#impact)Impact

The `order.price` in the parameter `tradeData` is not used as the actual token amount sent to the seaport market and also not checked if those are equal when using the `ERC20EnabledLooksRareAggregator` for `SeaportPorxy` with ERC20 tokens.

So users can set the order.price to ZERO to avoid paying any fees for ERC20 orders.

### [](#impact-1)Impact

The `call` opcode’s return value not checked, which could lead to the `originator` losing funds.

### [](#proof-of-concept-3)Proof of Concept

The caller of `LooksRareAggregator.sol::execute` could be a contract who may not implement the `fallback` or `receive` function, when a call to it with value sent, it will revert, thus failed to receive the ETH.

Let’s imagine the contract calls the `execute` function to buy multiple NFTs with ETH as the payout currency and make the `isAtomic` parameter being false. Since the batch buy of NFTs is not atomic, the failed transactions in LooksRare or Seaport marketplace will return the passed ETH. The contract doesn’t implement the `fallback/receive` function and the call opcode’s return value not checked, thus the ETH value will be trapped in the `LooksRareAggregator` contract until the next user call the `execute` function and the trapped ETH is returned to him. The `originator` lose funds.

        function _returnETHIfAny(address recipient) internal {
            assembly {
                if gt(selfbalance(), 0) {
                    let status := call(gas(), recipient, selfbalance(), 0, 0, 0, 0) // @audit-issue status not checked.
                }
            }
        }

### [](#recommended-mitigation-steps-4)Recommended Mitigation Steps

                if gt(selfbalance(), 0) {

                }
            }
            if (!status) revert ETHTransferFail();

### [](#vulnerability-details)Vulnerability Details

The `LooksRareAggregator` smart contract implements a bunch of functions to escape funds by the contract owner (see `rescueETH`, `rescueERC20`, `rescueERC721`, and `rescueERC1155`). In this way, any funds that were accidentally sent to the contract or were locked due to incorrect contract implementation can be returned to the owner. However, locked funds can be rescued by anyone without the owner’s permission. This is completely contrary to the idea of having rescue functions.

In order to withdraw funds from the contract, a user may just call the `execute` function in the `ERC20EnabledLooksRareAggregator` with `tokenTransfers` that contains the addresses of tokens to be withdrawn.

Thus, after the order execution `_returnERC20TokensIfAny` and `_returnETHIfAny` will be called, and the whole balance of provided ERC20 tokens and Ether will be returned to `msg.sender`.

Please note, that means that the owner can be front-ran with `rescue` functions and an attacker will receive funds instead.

### [](#impact-2)Impact

Useless of rescue functionality and vulnerability to jamming funds.

### [](#recommended-mitigation-steps-5)Recommended Mitigation Steps

`_returnETHIfAny` and `_returnERC20TokensIfAny` should return the amount of the token that was deposited.

> Keeping the Medium severity because the contract implements `TokenRescuer`, so the intent “that any ERC20 tokens sent there accidentally are free for all” totally makes sense but wasn’t clear prior to the audit. So I consider this a case where tokens that should belong to the protocol could be withdrawn by anyone.

[](#04-sanitythresholdlimit-checks)\[04\] Sanity/Threshold/Limit Checks
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Devoid of sanity/threshold/limit checks, critical parameters can be configured to invalid values, causing a variety of issues and breaking expected interactions within/between contracts. Consider adding proper `uint256` validation as well as zero address checks in the constructor. A worst case scenario would render the contract needing to be re-deployed in the event of human/accidental errors that involve value assignments to immutable variables. If the validation procedure is unclear or too complex to implement on-chain, document the potential issues that could produce invalid values.

Consider also adding an optional codehash check for immutable address at the constructor since the zero address check cannot guarantee a matching address has been inputted.

These checks are generally not implemented in the contracts. As an example, the following constructor may be refactored to:

[https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-11-looksrare/blob/main/contracts/proxies/LooksRareProxy.sol#L37-L40](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-11-looksrare/blob/main/contracts/proxies/LooksRareProxy.sol#L37-L40)

        constructor(address _marketplace, address _aggregator, bytes32 _marketplaceCodeHash, bytes32 _aggregatorCodeHash) {
            if (_marketplace == address(0) || _aggregator == address(0) || 
                _marketplace.codehash != _marketplaceCodeHash || _aggregator.codehash != _aggregatorCodeHash) {
                revert InvalidAddress();

[](#07-use-of-ecrecover-is-susceptible-to-signature-malleability)\[07\] Use of `ecrecover` is Susceptible to Signature Malleability
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The built-in EVM pre-compiled `ecrecover` featured in `SignatureChecker.sol`([https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-11-looksrare/blob/main/contracts/SignatureChecker.sol](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-11-looksrare/blob/main/contracts/SignatureChecker.sol)) is susceptible to signature malleability due to non-unique v and s (which may not always be in the lower half of the modulo set) values, possibly leading to replay attacks. Elsewhere if devoid of the adoption of nonces, this could prove a vulnerability when not carefully used.

Consider using OpenZeppelin’s ECDSA library which has been time tested in preventing this malleability where possible.

[](#08-lines-too-long)\[08\] Lines Too Long

Lines in source code are typically limited to 80 characters, but it’s reasonable to stretch beyond this limit when need be as monitor screens theses days are comparatively larger. Considering the files will most likely reside in GitHub that will have a scroll bar automatically kick in when the length is over 164 characters, all code lines and comments should be split when/before hitting this length. Keep line width to max 120 characters for better readability where possible. Here are some of the instances entailed:

[](#11-not-completely-using-openzeppelin-contracts)\[11\] Not Completely Using OpenZeppelin Contracts
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

OpenZeppelin maintains a library of standard, audited, community-reviewed, and battle-tested smart contracts. Instead of always importing these contracts, the protocol project re-implements them in some cases. This increases the amount of code that the protocol team will have to maintain and miss all the improvements and bug fixes that the OpenZeppelin team is constantly implementing with the help of the community.

Consider importing the OpenZeppelin contracts instead of re-implementing or copying them. These contracts can be extended to add the extra functionalities required if need be.

Here is one of the instances entailed:

[](#13-add-a-timelock-to-critical-parameter-change)\[13\] Add a Timelock to Critical Parameter Change
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

It is a good practice to give time for users to react and adjust to critical changes with a mandatory time window between them. The first step merely broadcasts to users that a particular change is coming, and the second step commits that change after a suitable waiting period. This allows users that do not accept the change to withdraw within the grace period. A timelock provides more guarantees and reduces the level of trust required, thus decreasing risk for users. It also indicates that the project is legitimate (less risk of a malicious Owner making any malicious or ulterior intention). Specifically, privileged roles could use front running to make malicious changes just ahead of incoming transactions, or purely accidental negative effects could occur due to the unfortunate timing of changes.

Consider extending the timelock feature beyond contract ownership management to business critical functions. Here are some of the instances entailed:

[https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-11-looksrare/blob/main/contracts/LooksRareAggregator.sol#L132](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-11-looksrare/blob/main/contracts/LooksRareAggregator.sol#L132)

[](#14-contract-owner-has-too-many-privileges)\[14\] Contract Owner Has Too Many Privileges
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The owner of the contracts has too many privileges relative to standard users. The consequence is disastrous if the contract owner’s private key has been compromised. And, in the event the key was lost or unrecoverable, no implementation upgrades and system parameter updates will ever be possible.

For a project this grand, it increases the likelihood that the owner will be targeted by an attacker, especially given the insufficient protection on sensitive owner private keys. The concentration of privileges creates a single point of failure; and, here are some of the incidents that could possibly transpire:

Transfer ownership and mess up with all the setter functions, hijacking the entire protocol.

Consider:

1.  splitting privileges (e.g. via the multisig option) to ensure that no one address has excessive ownership of the system,
2.  clearly documenting the functions and implementations the owner can change,
3.  documenting the risks associated with privileged users and single points of failure, and
4.  ensuring that users are aware of all the risks associated with the system.

[](#15-added-measures-when-calling-seaport-functions)\[15\] Added Measures When Calling Seaport Functions
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A high risk edge case bug associated with the Seaport `_validateOrderAndUpdateStatus()` was found in the [May code4rena audit contest.](https://code4rena.com/reports/2022-05-opensea-seaport#h-01-truncation-in-ordervalidator-can-lead-to-resetting-the-fill-and-selling-more-tokens) It concerns truncation to zero on both the numerator and the denominator particularly when involving a restricted token sale. The mitigation steps recommended was not deemed ideal then, and although the Seaport protocol team has since fixed this bug with added GCD measure and removing `unchecked {...}`, it is recommended adding the complementary check to circumvent any other hidden issues associated with it whilst having the error detected at its earliest possibility.

For instance, instead of allowing user to input `2**118` and `2**119` as numerator and denominator for an intended fraction of `1/2`, stem it by making sure that those two inputs could not be more than the total ERC721/1155 collection availability and multiply them with factor just enough to remove the decimals. Here are the two for loop instances entailed prior to calling `marketplace.fulfillAvailableAdvancedOrders()` and `marketplace.fulfillAdvancedOrder()`:

Saves a storage slot for the mapping. Depending on the circumstances and sizes of types, can avoid a Gsset (**20000 gas**) per mapping combined. Reads and subsequent writes can also be cheaper when a function requires both values and they both fit in the same storage slot. Finally, if both fields are accessed in the same function, can save **~42 gas per access** due to [not having to recalculate the key’s keccak256 hash](https://gist.github.com/IllIllI000/ec23a57daa30a8f8ca8b9681c8ccefb0) (Gkeccak256 - 30 gas) and that calculation’s associated stack operations.

[](#g02--using-calldata-instead-of-memory-for-read-only-arguments-in-external-functions-saves-gas)\[G‑02\] Using `calldata` instead of `memory` for read-only arguments in `external` functions saves gas
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When a function with a `memory` array is called externally, the `abi.decode()` step has to use a for-loop to copy each index of the `calldata` to the `memory` index. **Each iteration of this for-loop costs at least 60 gas** (i.e. `60 * <mem_array>.length`). Using `calldata` directly, obliviates the need for such a loop in the contract code and runtime execution. Note that even if an interface defines a function as having `memory` arguments, it’s still valid for implementation contracs to use `calldata` arguments instead.

If the array is passed to an `internal` function which passes the array to another internal function where the array is modified and therefore `memory` is used in the `external` call, it’s still more gass-efficient to use `calldata` when the `external` function uses modifiers, since the modifiers may prevent the internal functions from being called. Structs have the same overhead as an array of length one

Note that I’ve also flagged instances where the function is `public` but can be marked as `external` since it’s not called by the contract, and cases where a constructor is involved

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The instances below point to the second+ access of a state variable within a function. Caching of a state variable replaces each Gwarmaccess (**100 gas**) with a much cheaper stack read. Other less obvious fixes/optimizations include having local memory caches of state variable structs, or having local caches of state variable contracts/addresses.

`public`/`external` function names and `public` member variable names can be optimized to save gas. See [this](https://gist.github.com/IllIllI000/a5d8b486a8259f9f77891a919febd1a9) link for an example of how it works. Below are the interfaces/abstract contracts that can be optimized so that the most frequently-called functions use the least amount of gas possible during method lookup. Method IDs that have two leading zero bytes can save **128 gas** each during deployment, and renaming functions to have lower method IDs will save **22 gas** per call, [per sorted position shifted](https://medium.com/joyso/solidity-how-does-function-name-affect-gas-consumption-in-smart-contract-47d270d8ac92)

[](#g06--functions-guaranteed-to-revert-when-called-by-normal-users-can-be-marked-payable)\[G‑06\] Functions guaranteed to revert when called by normal users can be marked `payable`
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If a function modifier such as `onlyOwner` is used, the function will revert if a normal user tries to pay the function. Marking the function as `payable` will lower the gas cost for legitimate callers because the compiler will not include checks for whether a payment was provided. The extra opcodes avoided are `CALLVALUE`(2),`DUP1`(3),`ISZERO`(3),`PUSH2`(3),`JUMPI`(10),`PUSH1`(3),`DUP1`(3),`REVERT`(0),`JUMPDEST`(1),`POP`(2), which costs an average of about **21 gas per call** to the function, in addition to the extra deployment cost.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The overheads outlined below are _PER LOOP_, excluding the first loop

*   storage arrays incur a Gwarmaccess (**100 gas**)
*   memory arrays use `MLOAD` (**3 gas**)
*   calldata arrays use `CALLDATALOAD` (**3 gas**)

Caching the length changes each of these to a `DUP<N>` (**3 gas**), and gets rid of the extra `DUP<N>` needed to store the stack offset
