[](#about-c4)About C4
---------------------

Code4rena (C4) is an open organization consisting of security researchers, auditors, developers, and individuals with domain expertise in smart contracts.

A C4 audit contest is an event in which community participants, referred to as Wardens, review, audit, or analyze smart contract logic in exchange for a bounty provided by sponsoring projects.

During the audit contest outlined in this document, C4 conducted an analysis of the Canto v2 smart contract system written in Solidity. The audit contest took place between June 28—July 2 2022.

_Note: this audit contest originally ran under the name `New Blockchain v2`._

Final report assembled by [liveactionllama](https://twitter.com/liveactionllama).

[](#summary)Summary
===================

The C4 analysis yielded an aggregated total of 14 unique vulnerabilities. Of these vulnerabilities, 8 received a risk rating in the category of HIGH severity and 6 received a risk rating in the category of MEDIUM severity.

Additionally, C4 analysis included 34 reports detailing issues with a risk rating of LOW severity or non-critical. There were also 34 reports recommending gas optimizations.

All of the issues presented here are linked back to their original finding.

[](#scope)Scope
===============

The code under review can be found within the [C4 Canto v2 contest repository](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-canto-v2), and is composed of 15 smart contracts written in the Solidity programming language and includes 2,459 lines of Solidity code. One Cosmos SDK blockchain is also included.

[](#severity-criteria)Severity Criteria
=======================================

C4 assesses the severity of disclosed vulnerabilities according to a methodology based on [OWASP standards](https://owasp.org/www-community/OWASP_Risk_Rating_Methodology).

Vulnerabilities are divided into three primary risk categories: high, medium, and low/non-critical.

High-level considerations for vulnerabilities span the following key areas when conducting assessments:

*   Malicious Input Handling
*   Escalation of privileges
*   Arithmetic
*   Gas use

Further information regarding the severity criteria referenced throughout the submission review process, please refer to the documentation provided on [the C4 website](https://code4rena.com).

`_totalSupply` can be initialized to something different than 0, which would lead to an inaccurate total supply, and could easily break integrations, computations of market cap, etc.

### [](#proof-of-concept)Proof of Concept

If the constructor is called with \_initialSupply = 1000, the `totalSupply` will be initialized to 1000.

As all the others computations are correct, there will be for ever a discrepancy of 1000 between the real total supply and the one of the contract.

### [](#recommended-mitigation-steps)Recommended Mitigation Steps

Remove `_initialSupply`.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[https://github.dev/Plex-Engineer/lending-market-v2/blob/2646a7676b721db8a7754bf5503dcd712eab2f8a/contracts/CNote.sol#L148](https://github.dev/Plex-Engineer/lending-market-v2/blob/2646a7676b721db8a7754bf5503dcd712eab2f8a/contracts/CNote.sol#L148)  

The `CNote.doTransferOut` method is susceptible to denial of service.

### [](#proof-of-concept-1)Proof of Concept

The logic of the `doTransferOut` method in `CNote` is as follows:

        function doTransferOut(address payable to, uint amount) virtual override internal {
            require(address(_accountant) != address(0));
            EIP20Interface token = EIP20Interface(underlying);
            if (to != address(_accountant)) {
                uint err = _accountant.supplyMarket(amount);
                if (err != 0) { revert AccountantRedeemError(amount); }
            }   
            token.transfer(to, amount);
            bool success;
            assembly {
                switch returndatasize()
                    case 0 { success := not(0) }
                    case 32 { 
                        returndatacopy(0, 0, 32)
                        success := mload(0)
                    }
                    default { revert(0, 0) }
            } 
            require(success, "TOKEN_TRANSFER_OUT_FAILED");
            require(token.balanceOf(address(this)) == 0, "cNote::doTransferOut: TransferOut Failed"); // <-- ERROR
        }

The `doTransferOut` method receives an `amount` which is transferred to `to`, after it the balance of the contract token is checked to be equal to zero or the transaction will be reverted.

In the following cases a denial of service will occur:

*   In the case that is used an `amount` different than the balance, the transaction will be reverted.
*   **In the case that an attacker front-runs the transaction and sends one token more than the established by the `_accountant`.**
*   In case of increasing balance tokens like `mDai` that constantly change their balance, the established by the `_accountant` will be different when the transaction is persisted.

### [](#recommended-mitigation-steps-1)Recommended Mitigation Steps

*   Use balance differences instead of the 0 check.

**[nivasan1 (Canto) confirmed](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-canto-v2-findings/issues/43)**

**[Alex the Entreprenerd (judge) commented](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-canto-v2-findings/issues/43#issuecomment-1216823120):**

> The warden has shown how, anyone, via a simple transfer of `underlying` can deny the functionality of `doTransferOut`.

            address underlying;
    
            if (compareStrings(ctoken.symbol(), "cCANTO")) {
                stable = 0;
                underlying = address(wcanto);
            } 
            //set price statically to 1 when the Comptroller is retrieving Price
            else if (compareStrings(ctoken.symbol(), "cNOTE") && msg.sender == Comptroller) {
                return 1; // Note price is fixed to 1

TWAP oracle easily manipulated.

### [](#proof-of-concept-3)Proof of Concept

periodSize is set to 0 meaning that the oracle will take a new observation every single block, which would allow an attacker to easily flood the TWAP oracle and manipulate the price.

### [](#recommended-mitigation-steps-3)Recommended Mitigation Steps

Increase periodSize to be greater than 0, 1800 is typically standard.

The underlying price for LP pool pair can be manipulated. This kind of price mainpulation happened before, can be found here: [Warp Fincance event](https://rekt.news/warp-finance-rekt/).

Which may lead to the exploit of the pool by a malicious user.

                uint price0 = (token0 != USDC) ? IBaseV1Pair(pairFor(USDC, token0, stable0)).quote(token0, 1, 8) : 1;

                (uint amt0, uint amt1) = quoteRemoveLiquidity(token0, token1, stablePair, 1);
                price = amt0 * price0 + amt1 * price1;
    
    
        function quoteRemoveLiquidity(
            address tokenA,
            address tokenB,
            bool stable,
            uint liquidity
        ) public view returns (uint amountA, uint amountB) {
            // create the pair if it doesn"t exist yet
            address _pair = IBaseV1Factory(factory).getPair(tokenA, tokenB, stable);
    
            if (_pair == address(0)) {
                return (0,0);
            }
    
            (uint reserveA, uint reserveB) = getReserves(tokenA, tokenB, stable);
            uint _totalSupply = erc20(_pair).totalSupply();
    
            amountA = liquidity * reserveA / _totalSupply; // using balances ensures pro-rata distribution
            amountB = liquidity * reserveB / _totalSupply; // using balances ensures pro-rata distribution
    
        }

The price of the LP pair is determined by the TVL of the pool, given by:  
`amt0 * price0 + amt1 * price1`. However, when a malicious user dumps large amount of any token into the pool, the whole TVL will be significantly increased, which leads to inproper calculation of the price.

According to the documentation in `InterestRateModel`, `getBorrowRate` has to return the borrow rate per block and the function `borrowRatePerBlock` in `CToken` directly returns the value of `getBorrowRate`. However, the rate per year is returned for `NoteInterest`. Therefore, using `NoteInterest` as an interest model will result in completely wrong values.

### [](#recommended-mitigation-steps-5)Recommended Mitigation Steps

Return `baseRatePerBlock`.

The `sweepInterest` method is susceptible to denial of service.

### [](#proof-of-concept-5)Proof of Concept

The logic of the `sweepInterest` method relative to the `treasury` is as follows:

    		bool success = cnote.transfer(treasury, amtToSweep);
    		if (!success) { revert  SweepError(treasury , amtToSweep); }
    		TreasuryInterface Treas = TreasuryInterface(treasury);
    		Treas.redeem(address(cnote),amtToSweep);
    		require(cnote.balanceOf(treasury) == 0, "AccountantDelegate::sweepInterestError");

As you can see, `amtToSweep` is passed to it and `redeem` that amount. Later it is checked that the balance of `cnote` in the `treasury` address must be 0. However, all calculations related to `amtToSweep` come out of the balance of [address(this)](https://github.dev/Plex-Engineer/lending-market-v2/blob/2646a7676b721db8a7754bf5503dcd712eab2f8a/contracts/Accountant/AccountantDelegate.sol#L83-L84) so if a third party sends a single token `cnote` to the address of `treasury` the method will be denied.

In the sweepInterest function of the AccountantDelegate contract, the number of cnote sent to treasury should be cNoteToSweep instead of amtToSweep, as amtToSweep will normally be smaller than cNoteToSweep, which will cause the interest to be locked in the in the contract.

    		uint amtToSweep = sub_(cNoteAmt, noteDiff); // amount to sweep in Note, 
    		uint cNoteToSweep = div_(amtToSweep, exRate); // amount of cNote to sweep = amtToSweep(Note) / exRate
    
    		cNoteToSweep = (cNoteToSweep > cNoteBal) ? cNoteBal :  cNoteToSweep;

The `initialize` method of the contract `NoteInterest` can be initialized multiple times.

### [](#proof-of-concept-7)Proof of Concept

The method `initialize` of the contract `NoteInterest` looks like this:

        function initialize(address cnoteAddr, address oracleAddress) external {
            if (msg.sender != admin ) {
                revert SenderNotAdmin(msg.sender);
            }   
            address oldPriceOracle = address(oracle);
            cNote = CErc20(cnoteAddr);
            oracle = PriceOracle(oracleAddress);
            emit NewPriceOracle(oldPriceOracle, oracleAddress);
        }

Nothing prevents it from being initialized again and altering the initial values of the contract. This allows the government, unnecessarily, to be able to perform attacks such as altering the logic of the `updateBaseRate` method.

### [](#recommended-mitigation-steps-8)Recommended Mitigation Steps

Add a require to check that was not already initialized.

The `CErc20Delegator` is still using `delegateToViewImplementation` for those functions. Those functions can be used, as long as the implementation does not update any state variables, i.e. [the block number increase since the last update is less or equal to the `updateFrequency`](https://github.com/Plex-Engineer/lending-market-v2/blob/443a8c0fed3c5018e95f3881a31b81a555c42b2d/contracts/NoteInterest.sol#L141). However, when these functions are called after sufficient blocks are mined, they are going to revert.  
Although one can still call the implementation using [`delegateToImplementation`](https://github.com/Plex-Engineer/lending-market-v2/blob/443a8c0fed3c5018e95f3881a31b81a555c42b2d/contracts/CErc20Delegator.sol#L437), it is not a good usability, especially if those functions are used for external user interface.

The gist shows a simple test. It calls `borrowRatePerBlock` and `supplyRatePerBlock` first time, it suceeds. Then, it mines for more than 300 times, which is the `updateFrequency` parameter. Then it calls again then fails.

Instead of using `delegateToViewImplementation` use `delegateToImplementation`. Alternatively, implement view functions to query these rates in `NoteInterest.sol` and `CToken.sol`. It will enable to query the rates without spending gas.

There is potential to call initialize() on `AccountantDelegate.sol` more than once because the require statement only checks if the state variables != address(0)

However, if the admin is set to WETH address mistakenly, user could not claim through [Comptroller.sol#L1381](https://github.com/Plex-Engineer/lending-market-v2/blob/main/contracts/Comptroller.sol#L1381). Admin can break the protocol.

Set WETH address through initializer or change it through governance.

The fact that there is no cap on the amount of Note that can be borrowed makes the Oracle Extractable Value unlimited. But as you intend to rely on TWAP, you need to make sure the cost of oracle manipulation is lower than the Oracle Extractable Value.

### [](#proof-of-concept-10)Proof of Concept

By manipulating the TWAPs of the designated proxy used for Note (USDC ?) and its relative price to a given collateral(which would be highly costly), an attacker could borrow Note without limit, and empty all pools related to Note and all Note-related value, instantly killing the stablecoin.

The value extractable by Oracle Manipulations is usually easily computable as it is the size of the lending market, but here, it’s more difficult to evaluate as it could potentially be any value linked to Note. This makes risk management harder and increase significantly the risk of attack.

Therefore a cap on how many Notes can be borrowed needs to be added to mitigate this risk.

The attack would be:

*   Manipulate the USDC / Collateral TWAP to be able to borrow Note with less than 1$ of collateral, which would be costly.
*   Extract all the value possible linked to Note, for example:
    
    *   by buying all the tokens from pools Note / token at a discount
    *   by supplying Notes to the lending platform and borrow collaterals for which the Note price is still at 1$
    *   etc

Essentially as you have no cap on the amount of Note that could be borrowed in such a scenario, you cannot be sure that the potential attack profits are lower than the attack cost.

### [](#recommended-mitigation-steps-12)Recommended Mitigation Steps

The governance needs to set a limit on how much Note can be borrowed to mitigate risks, or add for example an “hourly” borrowing limit.

Easiest way to do this would be able to mint / burn from the accountant.

The `getUnderlyingPrice` function returns 1, when Comptroller is calling with `CNote`. The Comptroller is using the given price as [mantissa](https://github.com/Plex-Engineer/lending-market-v2/blob/443a8c0fed3c5018e95f3881a31b81a555c42b2d/contracts/Comptroller.sol#L757), which has [18 decimal precision](https://github.com/Plex-Engineer/lending-market-v2/blob/443a8c0fed3c5018e95f3881a31b81a555c42b2d/contracts/Comptroller.sol#L757).

              delegateTo(implementation, abi.encodeWithSignature("_acceptInitialAdmin()"));
    

When the `GovernorBravoDelegator` is used with `GovernorBravoDelegate` as the implementation, the function `_acceptInitialAdminDelegated` will revert since the `GovernorBravoDelegate` does not have `_acceptInitialAdmin` function.

                  reserve1CumulativeLast += _reserve1 * timeElapsed;
    

The BaseV1-core is using solidity version 0.8.11, so it will revert when overflow or underflow happens. Upon cumulating the time weighted reserve, it is desired to overflow. Likewise it is desired to underflow calculating price average. It also saves gas usage, to use unchecked block for those calculations.

    *   it is good to check admin for zero address, otherwise admin access will be lost forever. To renounce the admin, it is safer to add a separate function.

When updating an implementation for a proxy, it is important to keep the storage structure. Putting non-constant state variables in a dedicated storage contract is less error-prone approach. Although CErc20Delegate has a storage contract in its inheritance tree, a state variable `_accountant` was introduced in `CNote`. Therefore, extra care should be paid to the state variable.

The uint256 variables are casted into `int` without checking for overflow. It is probably safe in this use case, but to be sure one may use [SafeCast](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/7a8f269457ca252605f03f8c2f8a333da6be1709/contracts/utils/math/SafeCast.sol#L1130-L1134).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Shortening revert strings to fit in 32 bytes will decrease deployment time gas and will decrease runtime gas when the revert condition is met.

Revert strings that are longer than 32 bytes require at least one additional mstore, along with additional overhead for computing memory offset, etc.

I suggest shortening the revert strings to fit in 32 bytes, or that using custom errors as described next.

### [](#use-custom-errors-instead-of-revert-strings-to-save-gas)Use Custom Errors instead of Revert Strings to save Gas

Custom errors from Solidity 0.8.4 are cheaper than revert strings (cheaper deployment cost and runtime cost when the revert condition is met)

#### [](#source-custom-errors-in-solidity)Source Custom Errors in Solidity:

Starting from Solidity v0.8.4, there is a convenient and gas-efficient way to explain to users why an operation failed through the use of custom errors. Until now, you could already use strings to give more information about failures (e.g., revert(“Insufficient funds.”);), but they are rather expensive, especially when it comes to deploy cost, and it is difficult to use dynamic information in them.

Custom errors are defined using the error statement, which can be used inside and outside of contracts (including interfaces and libraries).

Below are some examples, but the code has a lot of them, it is recommended to change all `require` phrases to custom errors.

[](#g-05-i-costs-less-gas-compared-to-i-or-i--1)\[G-05\] `++i` costs less gas compared to `i++` or `i += 1`
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

`++i` costs less gas compared to `i++` or `i += 1` for unsigned integer, as pre-increment is cheaper (about 5 gas per iteration). This statement is true even with the optimizer enabled.

`i++` increments `i` and returns the initial value of `i`. Which means:

    uint i = 1;
    i++; // == 1 but i == 2

But `++i` returns the actual incremented value:

    uint i = 1;
    ++i; // == 2 and i == 2 too, so no need for a temporary variable

In the first case, the compiler has to create a temporary variable (when used) for returning `1` instead of `2`.  
I suggest using `++i` instead of `i++` to increment the value of an uint variable. Same thing for `--i` and `i--`

*   [Reservoir.sol#L103](https://github.com/Plex-Engineer/lending-market-v2/blob/2646a7676b721db8a7754bf5503dcd712eab2f8a/contracts/Reservoir.sol#L103)

[](#g-12-unckecked-keyword)\[G-12\] `unckecked` keyword
-------------------------------------------------------

It’s possible to save gas using the `unckecked` keyword. This will avoid the required checks to ensure that the variable won’t overflow.

Reference:

*   [https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.0/control-structures.html#checked-or-unchecked-arithmetic](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.0/control-structures.html#checked-or-unchecked-arithmetic)

The balance was checked before, it can be subtracted without checking overflows:

*   [WETH.sol#L73](https://github.com/Plex-Engineer/lending-market-v2/blob/2646a7676b721db8a7754bf5503dcd712eab2f8a/contracts/WETH.sol#L73)
*   [WETH.sol#L76](https://github.com/Plex-Engineer/lending-market-v2/blob/2646a7676b721db8a7754bf5503dcd712eab2f8a/contracts/WETH.sol#L76)
*   [ERC20.sol#L213](https://github.com/Plex-Engineer/lending-market-v2/blob/2646a7676b721db8a7754bf5503dcd712eab2f8a/contracts/ERC20.sol#L213)

[](#g-13-use-constant-instead-of-storage)\[G-13\] use `constant` instead of storage
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Use constant instead of storage and change from `uint256 MAX_INT = 2**256-1;` to `uint256 private constant MAX_INT = type(uint256).max;`:

*   [ERC20.sol#L18](https://github.com/Plex-Engineer/lending-market-v2/blob/2646a7676b721db8a7754bf5503dcd712eab2f8a/contracts/ERC20.sol#L18)

[](#g-14-unrequired-method)\[G-14\] Unrequired method
-----------------------------------------------------

Method not necessary since the implemented logic only calls to obtain the current block.

Affected source code:

*   [CToken.sol#L201](https://github.com/Plex-Engineer/lending-market-v2/blob/2646a7676b721db8a7754bf5503dcd712eab2f8a/contracts/CToken.sol#L201)

[](#g-15-optimize-logic)\[G-15\] Optimize logic
-----------------------------------------------

The logic of the `CToken.transferTokens` method can bypass the `startingAllowance` condition and the `allowanceNew` variable if the `spender` and `src` checks are done at the same time the tokens are subtracted.

    if (spender == src) {
        transferAllowances[src][spender] -= tokens;
    }

Affected source code:

*   [CToken.sol#L82](https://github.com/Plex-Engineer/lending-market-v2/blob/2646a7676b721db8a7754bf5503dcd712eab2f8a/contracts/CToken.sol#L82)

[](#g-16-use-memory-instead-of-storage)\[G-16\] Use `memory` instead of `storage`
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Changing `storage` to `memory` we can save some storage access.

Affected source code:

*   [CToken.sol#L255](https://github.com/Plex-Engineer/lending-market-v2/blob/2646a7676b721db8a7754bf5503dcd712eab2f8a/contracts/CToken.sol#L255)
