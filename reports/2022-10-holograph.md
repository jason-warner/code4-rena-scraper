[](#about-c4)About C4
---------------------

Code4rena (C4) is an open organization consisting of security researchers, auditors, developers, and individuals with domain expertise in smart contracts.

A C4 audit contest is an event in which community participants, referred to as Wardens, review, audit, or analyze smart contract logic in exchange for a bounty provided by sponsoring projects.

During the audit contest outlined in this document, C4 conducted an analysis of the Holograph smart contract system written in Solidity. The audit contest took place between October 18—October 25 2022.

This contest was judged by [gzeon](https://twitter.com/gzeon).

Final report assembled by [liveactionllama](https://twitter.com/liveactionllama).

[](#summary)Summary
===================

The C4 analysis yielded an aggregated total of 27 unique vulnerabilities. Of these vulnerabilities, 8 received a risk rating in the category of HIGH severity and 19 received a risk rating in the category of MEDIUM severity.

Additionally, C4 analysis included 113 reports detailing issues with a risk rating of LOW severity or non-critical. There were also 99 reports recommending gas optimizations.

All of the issues presented here are linked back to their original finding.

[](#scope)Scope
===============

The code under review can be found within the [C4 Holograph contest repository](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-10-holograph), and is composed of 10 smart contracts written in the Solidity programming language and includes 2,614 lines of Solidity code.

[](#severity-criteria)Severity Criteria
=======================================

C4 assesses the severity of disclosed vulnerabilities according to a methodology based on [OWASP standards](https://owasp.org/www-community/OWASP_Risk_Rating_Methodology).

Vulnerabilities are divided into three primary risk categories: high, medium, and low/non-critical.

High-level considerations for vulnerabilities span the following key areas when conducting assessments:

*   Malicious Input Handling
*   Escalation of privileges
*   Arithmetic
*   Gas use

Further information regarding the severity criteria referenced throughout the submission review process, please refer to the documentation provided on [the C4 website](https://code4rena.com).

[](#h-01-an-attacker-can-lock-operator-out-of-the-pod-by-setting-gas-limit-thats-higher-than-the-block-gas-limit-of-dest-chain)[\[H-01\] An attacker can lock operator out of the pod by setting gas limit that’s higher than the block gas limit of dest chain](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-10-holograph-findings/issues/414)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

_Submitted by 0xA5DF, also found by 0x52_

[HolographOperator.sol#L415](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-10-holograph/blob/f8c2eae866280a1acfdc8a8352401ed031be1373/contracts/HolographOperator.sol#L415)  

When a beaming job is executed, there’s a requirement that the gas left would be at least as the `gasLimit` set by the user. Given that there’s no limit on the `gasLimit` the user can set, a user can set the `gasLimit` to amount that’s higher than the block gas limit on the dest chain, causing the operator to fail to execute the job.

### [](#impact)Impact

Operators would be locked out of the pod, unable to execute any more jobs and not being able to get back the bond they paid.

The attacker would have to pay a value equivalent to the gas fee if that amount was realistic (i.e. `gasPrice` \* `gasLimit` in dest chain native token), but this can be a relative low amount for Polygon and Avalanche chain (for Polygon that’s 20M gas limit and `200 Gwei gas = 4 Matic`, for Avalanche the block gas limit seems to be 8M and the price `~30 nAVAX = 0.24 AVAX`). Plus, the operator isn’t going to receive that amount.

### [](#proof-of-concept)Proof of Concept

The following test demonstrates this scenario:

During the beaming process the user compensates the operator for the gas he has to pay by sending some source-chain-native-tokens via `hToken`.  
The amount he has to pay is determined according to the `gasPrice` set by the user, which is supposed to be the maximum gas price to be used on dest chain (therefore predicting the max gas fee the operator would pay and paying him the same value in src chain native tokens).  
However, in case the user sets a low price (as low as 1 wei) the operator can’t skip the job because he’s locked out of the pod till he executes the job.  
The operator would have to choose between loosing money by paying a higher gas fee than he’s compensated for or being locked out of the pod - not able to execute additional jobs or get back his bonded amount.  

### [](#impact-1)Impact

Operator would be losing money by having to pay gas fee that’s higher than the compensation (gas fee can be a few dozens of USD for heavy txs).  
This could also be used by attackers to make operators pay for the attackers’ expensive gas tasks:

*   They can deploy their own contract as the ‘source contract’
*   Use the `bridgeIn` event and the `data` that’s being sent to it to instruct the source contract what operations need to be executed
*   They can use it for execute operations where the `tx.origin` doesn’t matter (e.g. USDc gasless send)

### [](#proof-of-concept-1)Proof of Concept

*   An operator can’t execute any further jobs or leave the pod till the job is executed. From [the docs](https://docs.holograph.xyz/holograph-protocol/operator-network-specification#:~:text=When%20an%20operator%20is%20selected%20for%20a%20job%2C%20they%20are%20temporarily%20removed%20from%20the%20pod%2C%20until%20they%20complete%20the%20job.%20If%20an%20operator%20successfully%20finalizes%20a%20job%2C%20they%20earn%20a%20reward%20and%20are%20placed%20back%20into%20their%20selected%20pod.):

> When an operator is selected for a job, they are temporarily removed from the pod, until they complete the job. If an operator successfully finalizes a job, they earn a reward and are placed back into their selected pod.

*   Operator can’t skip a job. Can’t prove a negative but that’s pretty clear from reading the code.
*   There’s indeed a third option - that some other operator/user would execute the job instead of the selected operator, but a) the operator would get slashed for that. b) If the compensation is lower than the gas fee then other users have no incentive to execute it as well.

### [](#recommended-mitigation-steps-1)Recommended Mitigation Steps

Allow operator to opt out of executing the job if the `gasPrice` is higher than the current gas price.

[LayerZeroModule.sol#L431-L445](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-10-holograph/blob/f8c2eae866280a1acfdc8a8352401ed031be1373/contracts/module/LayerZeroModule.sol#L431-L445)  

Holograph gets its cross chain messaging primitives through Layer Zero. To get pricing estimate, it uses the DstConfig price struct exposed in LZ’s [RelayerV2](https://github.com/LayerZero-Labs/LayerZero/blob/main/contracts/RelayerV2.sol#L133).

The issue is that the important baseGas and gasPerByte configuration parameters, which are used to calculate a custom amount of gas for the destination LZ message, use the values that come from the _source_ chain. This is in contrast to LZ which handles DstConfigs in a mapping keyed by chainID. The encoded gas amount is described [here](https://layerzero.gitbook.io/docs/guides/advanced/relayer-adapter-parameters).

### [](#impact-2)Impact

The impact is that when those fields are different between chains, one of two things may happen:

1.  Less severe - we waste excess gas, which is refunded to the lzReceive() caller (Layer Zero)
2.  More severe - we underprice the delivery cost, causing lzReceive() to revert and the NFT stuck in limbo forever.

The code does not handle a failed lzReceive (differently to a failed executeJob). Therefore, no failure event is emitted and the NFT is screwed.

### [](#recommended-mitigation-steps-2)Recommended Mitigation Steps

Firstly, make sure to use the target gas costs.  
Secondly, re-engineer lzReceive to be fault-proof, i.e. save some gas to emit result event.

In [contracts/HolographOperator.sol#crossChainMessage](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-10-holograph/blob/main/contracts/HolographOperator.sol#L484-L539), each Operator is selected by:

*   Generating a random number ([L499](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-10-holograph/blob/main/contracts/HolographOperator.sol#L499))
*   A pod is selected by dividing the random with the total number of pods, and using the remainder ([L503](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-10-holograph/blob/main/contracts/HolographOperator.sol#L503))
*   An Operator of the selected pod is chosen using the **same** random and dividing by the total number of operators ([L511](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-10-holograph/blob/main/contracts/HolographOperator.sol#L511)).

This creates an unintended bias since the first criterion (the `random`) is used for both selecting the pod and selecting the Operator, as explained in a previous issue (`M001-Biased distribution`). In this case, an attacker knowing this flaw can continuously monitor the contracts state and see the current number of pods and Operators. Accordingly to the [documentation](https://docs.holograph.xyz/holograph-protocol/operator-network-specification#operator-job-selection) and provided [flow](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-10-holograph/blob/main/docs/IMPORTANT_FLOWS.md#joining-pods):

*   An Operator can easily join and leave a pod, albeit when leaving a small fee is paid
*   An Operator can only join one pod, but an attacker can control multiple Operators
*   The attacker can then enter and leave a pod to increase (unfairly) his odds of being selected for a job

Honest Operators may feel compelled to leave the protocol if there are no financial incentives (and lose funds in the process), which can also increase the odds of leaving the end-users at the hands of a malicious Operator.

At this stage, an attacker Mallory joins the protocol and scans the protocol (or interacts with - e.g. `getTotalPods`, `getPodOperatorsLength`). As an example, after considering the potential benefits, she chooses pod `P9` and sets up some bots `[B1, B2, B3]`. The number of Operators will determine the odds, so:

And then:

1.  She waits for the next job to fall in `P9` and keeps an eye on the number of pods, since it could change the odds.
2.  After an Operator is selected (he [pops](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-10-holograph/blob/main/contracts/HolographOperator.sol#L518) from the array), the number of available Operators change to 5, and the odds change to `P9B`.
3.  She deploys `B1` and it goes to position `Op5`, odds back to `P9`. If the meantime the previously chosen Operator comes back to the `pod`, see the alternative timeline.
4.  She now has 1/3 of the probability to be chosen for the next job:

4.1 If she is not chosen, [she will assume the position](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-10-holograph/blob/main/contracts/HolographOperator.sol#L1138-L1144) of the chosen Operator, and deploys `B2` to maintain the odds of `P9` and controls 2/3 of the pod. 4.2 If she is chosen, she chooses between employing another bot or waiting to execute the job to back to the pod (keeping the original odds). 5. She can then iterate multiple times to swap to the remainder of possible indexes via step 4.1.

Alternative timeline (from previous 3.):

1.  The chosen Operator finishes the job and goes back to the pod. Now there’s 7 members with uniform odds (`P9C`).
2.  Mallory deploys `B2` and the length grows to 8, the odds turn to `P9D` and she now controls two of the four possible indexes from which she can be chosen.

There are a lot of ramifications and possible outcomes that Mallory can manipulate to increase the odds of being selected in her favor.

### [](#recommended-mitigation-steps-3)Recommended Mitigation Steps

As stated in [`M001-Biased distribution`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-10-holograph-findings/issues/167), use two random numbers for pod and Operator selection. Ideally, an independent source for randomness should be used, but following the assumption that the one used in [L499](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-10-holograph/blob/main/contracts/HolographOperator.sol#L499) is safe enough, using the most significant bits (e.g. `random >> 128`) should guarantee an unbiased distribution. Also, reading the [EIP-4399](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4399) could be valuable.

Additionally, since randomness in blockchain is always tricky to achieve without an oracle provider, consider adding additional controls (e.g. waiting times before joining each pod) to increase the difficulty of manipulating the protocol.

And finally, in this particular case, removing the swapping mechanism (moving the last index to the chosen operator’s current index) for another mechanism (shifting could also create conflicts [with backup operators?](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-10-holograph/blob/main/contracts/HolographOperator.sol#L358-L370)) could also increase the difficulty of manipulating a particular pod.

Operators in Holograph do their job by calling executeJob() with the bridged in bytes from source chain.  
If the primary job operator did not execute the job during his allocated block slot, he is punished by taking a single bond amount and transfer it to the operator doing it instead.  
The docs and code state that if there was a gas spike in the operator’s slot, he shall not be punished. The way a gas spike is checked is with this code in executeJob:

    require(gasPrice >= tx.gasprice, "HOLOGRAPH: gas spike detected");

However, there is still a way for operator to claim primary operator’s bond amount although gas price is high. Attacker can submit a flashbots bundle including the executeJob() transaction, and one additional “bribe” transaction. The bribe transaction will transfer some incentive amount to coinbase address (miner), while the executeJob is submitted with a low gasprice. Miner will accept this bundle as it is overall rewarding enough for them, and attacker will receive the base bond amount from victim operator. This threat is not theoretical because every block we see MEV bots squeezing value from such opportunities.

             */
            _bondedAmounts[msg.sender] += amount;

Since you have designed a mechanism to prevent other operators to slash the operator due to “the selected missed the time slot due to a gas spike”. It can induce that operators won’t perform their job if a gas price spike happens due to negative profit.

But your designed mechanism has a vulnerability. Other operators can submit their transaction to the mempool and queue it using `gasPrice in bridgeInRequestPayload`. It may get executed before the selected operator as the selected operator is waiting for the gas price to drop but doesn’t submit any transaction yet. If it doesn’t, these operators lose a little gas fee. But a slashed reward may be greater than the risk of losing a little gas fee.

    require(timeDifference > 0, "HOLOGRAPH: operator has time");

Once 1 epoch has passed, selected operator is vulnerable to slashing and frontrunning.

### [](#recommended-mitigation-steps-5)Recommended Mitigation Steps

Modify your operator node software to queue transactions immediately with `gasPrice in bridgeInRequestPayload` if a gas price spike happened. Or allow gas fee loss tradeoff to prevent being slashed.

    function executeJob(bytes calldata bridgeInRequestPayload) external payable {
    ...
    delete _operatorJobs[hash];
    ...
        try
          HolographOperatorInterface(address(this)).nonRevertingBridgeCall{value: msg.value}(
            msg.sender,

          _failedJobs[hash] = true;
          emit FailedOperatorJob(hash);
        }
    }

First, it will `delete _operatorJobs[hash];` to have it not replayable.

Next, assume `nonRevertingBridgeCall` failed. NFT won’t be minted and the catch block is entered.

`_failedJobs[hash]` is set to true and event is emitted

Notice that `_operatorJobs[hash]` has been deleted, so this job is not replayable. This mean NFT is lost forever since we can’t retry executeJob.

### [](#recommended-mitigation-steps-6)Recommended Mitigation Steps

Move `delete _operatorJobs[hash];` to the end of function executeJob covered in `if (!_failedJobs[hash])`

    ...
    if (!_failedJobs[hash]) delete _operatorJobs[hash];
    ...

But this implementation is not safe. The selected operator may get slashed. Additionally, you may need to check `_failedJobs` flag to allow retry for only the selected operator.

[HolographOperator.sol#L316](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-10-holograph/blob/f8c2eae866280a1acfdc8a8352401ed031be1373/src/HolographOperator.sol#L316)  

There’s a check at line 316 that verifies that there’s enough gas left to execute the `HolographBridge.bridgeInRequest()` with the `gasLimit` set by the user, however the actual amount of gas left during the call is less than that (mainly due to the `1/64` rule, see below).  
An attacker can use that gap to fail the job while still having the `executeJob()` function complete.

### [](#impact-4)Impact

The owner of the bridged token would loose access to the token since the job failed.

### [](#proof-of-concept-3)Proof of Concept

Besides using a few units of gas between the check and the actual call, there’s also a rule that only 63/64 of the remaining gas would be dedicated to an (external) function call. Since there are 2 external function calls done (`nonRevertingBridgeCall()` and the actual call to the bridge) `~2/64` of the gas isn’t sent to the bridge call and can be used after the bridge call runs out of gas.

The following PoC shows that if the amount of gas left before the call is at least 1 million then the execution can continue after the bridge call fails:

                _failedJobs[hash] = true;
                emit FailedOperatorJob(hash);
            }

        }
    
        function intermediate() public{
            bridge.bridgeCall();
        }

    contract Bridge{
        event Done(uint gasLeft);
    
        uint256[] myArr;
    
        function bridgeCall() public {
            for(uint i =1; i <= 100; i++){
                myArr.push(i);
            }
            // this line would never be reached, we'll be out of gas beforehand
            emit Done(gasleft());
        }
    }

Output of PoC:

      Gas left before call:  999772
      Gas left after failure:  30672
      Gas left at end:  1628

Side note: due to some bug in forge `_inboundMessageCounter` would be considered warm even though it’s not necessarily the case. However in a real world scenario we can warm it up if the selected operator is a contract and we’er using another operator contract to execute a job in the same tx beforehand.

### [](#recommended-mitigation-steps-7)Recommended Mitigation Steps

Modify the required amount of gas left to gasLimit + any amount of gas spent before reaching the `call()`, then multiply it by `32/30` to mitigate the `1/64` rule (+ some margin of safety maybe).

[ERC721H.sol#L185](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-10-holograph/blob/f8c2eae866280a1acfdc8a8352401ed031be1373/contracts/abstract/ERC721H.sol#L185)  
[ERC721H.sol#L121](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-10-holograph/blob/f8c2eae866280a1acfdc8a8352401ed031be1373/contracts/abstract/ERC721H.sol#L121)  

ERC20H and ERC721H are base contracts for NFTs / coins to inherit from. They supply the modifier onlyOwner and function isOwner which are used in the implementations for access control. However, there are several functions which when using these the answer may be corrupted to true by an attacker.

The issue comes from confusion between calls coming from HolographERC721’s fallback function, and calls from actually implemented functions.

In the fallback function, the enforcer appends an additional 32 bytes of `msg.sender`:

    assembly {
      calldatacopy(0, 0, calldatasize())
      mstore(calldatasize(), caller())
      let result := call(gas(), sload(_sourceContractSlot), callvalue(), 0, add(calldatasize(), 32), 0, 0)
      returndatacopy(0, 0, returndatasize())
      switch result
      case 0 {
        revert(0, returndatasize())
      }
      default {
        return(0, returndatasize())
      }
    }

Indeed these are the bytes read as msgSender:

    function msgSender() internal pure returns (address sender) {
      assembly {
        sender := calldataload(sub(calldatasize(), 0x20))
      }
    }

and isOwner simply compares these to the stored owner:

    function isOwner() external view returns (bool) {
      if (msg.sender == holographer()) {
        return msgSender() == _getOwner();
      } else {
        return msg.sender == _getOwner();
      }
    }

However, the enforcer calls these functions directly in several locations, and in these cases it of course does not append a 32 byte msg.sender. For example, in safeTransferFrom:

    function safeTransferFrom(
      address from,
      address to,
      uint256 tokenId,
      bytes memory data
    ) public payable {
      require(_isApproved(msg.sender, tokenId), "ERC721: not approved sender");
      if (_isEventRegistered(HolographERC721Event.beforeSafeTransfer)) {
        require(SourceERC721().beforeSafeTransfer(from, to, tokenId, data));
      }
      _transferFrom(from, to, tokenId);
      if (_isContract(to)) {
        require(
          (ERC165(to).supportsInterface(ERC165.supportsInterface.selector) &&
            ERC165(to).supportsInterface(ERC721TokenReceiver.onERC721Received.selector) &&
            ERC721TokenReceiver(to).onERC721Received(address(this), from, tokenId, data) ==
            ERC721TokenReceiver.onERC721Received.selector),
          "ERC721: onERC721Received fail"
        );
      }
      if (_isEventRegistered(HolographERC721Event.afterSafeTransfer)) {
        require(SourceERC721().afterSafeTransfer(from, to, tokenId, data));
      }
    }

Here, caller has arbitrary control of the data parameter, and can pass owner’s address.When the implementation, SourceERC721(), gets called, beforeSafeTransfer / afterSafeTransfer will behave as if they are called by owner.

Therefore, depending on the actual implementation, derived contracts can lose funds by specifying owner-specific logic.

This pattern occurs with the following functions, which have an arbitrary data parameter:

*   beforeSafeTransfer / after SafeTransfer

Imo the modifier is working as intended and it is the developers responsibility to understand the consequences of making a call from the Holographer (which is a privileged account) regardless. Everything can be misused does not mean they are Med/High risk unless you can provide an actual exploit.

> I have brought up mint() as an example of using onlyOwner in the ERC721 implementation. I will reiterate that the issue is confusion between calls coming from HolographERC721’s fallback function, and calls from Enforcer’s transferFrom / safeTransferFrom / etc. When the list of functions above (beforeTransferFrom/ afterTransferFrom / etc) are called NOT from the fallback, which happens in transferFrom / safeTransferFrom / onERC20Received, the sender can pass any “data” parameter they wish, which will be interpreted by the isOwner function as the passed sender in the last 32 bytes.
> 
> “Everything can be misused does not mean they are Med/High risk unless you can provide an actual exploit.” - The problem is that it will NOT be developer misuse to use isOwner / onlyOwner in ERC721/ERC20 implementation, it’s use of inherited functionality (like in SampleERC721.sol example). There is no warning that owner check is not safe from “beforeOnERC20Received”, for example. Protocol is likely shooting themselves in the foot if they don’t protect from owner checks in these functions.

Also they can’t manipulate unless it is called from the Holographer, which have limited affordance.

Payout is blocked and tokens are stuck in contract.

### [](#proof-of-concept-4)Proof of Concept

`PA1D._payoutToken()` and `PA1D._payoutTokens()` call `ERC20.transfer()` in a require-statement to send tokens to a list of payout recipients.  
Some tokens do not return a bool (e.g. USDT, BNB, OMG) on ERC20 methods. But since the require-statement expects a `bool`, for such a token a `void` return will also cause a revert, despite an otherwise successful transfer. That is, the token payout will always revert for such tokens.

### [](#recommended-mitigation-steps-9)Recommended Mitigation Steps

Use [OpenZeppelin’s SafeERC20](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC20/utils/SafeERC20.sol), which handles the return value check as well as non-standard-compliant tokens.

[HolographOperator.sol#L255](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-10-holograph/blob/f8c2eae866280a1acfdc8a8352401ed031be1373/src/HolographOperator.sol#L255)  

If the following conditions have been met:

*   The selected operator doesn’t complete the job, either intentionally (they’re sacrificing their bonded amount to harm the token owner) or innocently (hardware failure that caused a loss of access to the wallet)
*   Gas price has spiked, and isn’t going down than the `gasPrice` set by the user in the bridge out request

Then the bridging request wouldn’t complete and the token owner would loos access to the token till the gas price goes back down again.

### [](#proof-of-concept-5)Proof of Concept

The fact that no one but the selected operator can execute the job in case of a gas spike has been proven by the test [‘Should fail if there has been a gas spike’](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-10-holograph/blob/f8c2eae866280a1acfdc8a8352401ed031be1373/test/14_holograph_operator_tests.ts#L834-L844) provided by the sponsor.

An example of a price spike can be in the recent month in the Ethereum Mainnet where the min gas price was 3 at Oct 8, but jumped to 14 the day after and didn’t go down since then (the min on Oct 9 was lower than the avg of Oct8, but users might witness a momentarily low gas price and try to hope on it). See the [gas price chat on Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/chart/gasprice) for more details.

### [](#recommended-mitigation-steps-10)Recommended Mitigation Steps

In case of a gas price spike, instead of refusing to let other operators to execute the job, let them execute the job without slashing the selected operator. This way, after a while also the owner can execute the job and pay the gas price.

A job is considered successful if it does not revert, or if it reverts but gas limits were followed correctly.

[HolographERC721.sol#L467](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-10-holograph/blob/f8c2eae866280a1acfdc8a8352401ed031be1373/contracts/enforcer/HolographERC721.sol#L467)  

HolographERC721.sol is an enforcer contract that fully implements ERC721. In its safeTransferFromFunction there is the following code:

    if (_isContract(to)) {
      require(
        (ERC165(to).supportsInterface(ERC165.supportsInterface.selector) &&
          ERC165(to).supportsInterface(ERC721TokenReceiver.onERC721Received.selector) &&
          ERC721TokenReceiver(to).onERC721Received(address(this), from, tokenId, data) ==
          ERC721TokenReceiver.onERC721Received.selector),
        "ERC721: onERC721Received fail"
      );
    }

If the target address is a contract, the enforcer requires the target’s `onERC721Received()` to succeed. However, the call deviates from the [standard](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721):

    interface ERC721TokenReceiver {
        /// @notice Handle the receipt of an NFT
        /// @dev The ERC721 smart contract calls this function on the recipient
        ///  after a `transfer`. This function MAY throw to revert and reject the
        ///  transfer. Return of other than the magic value MUST result in the
        ///  transaction being reverted.
        ///  Note: the contract address is always the message sender.
        /// @param _operator The address which called `safeTransferFrom` function
        /// @param _from The address which previously owned the token
        /// @param _tokenId The NFT identifier which is being transferred
        /// @param _data Additional data with no specified format
        /// @return `bytes4(keccak256("onERC721Received(address,address,uint256,bytes)"))`
        ///  unless throwing
        function onERC721Received(address _operator, address _from, uint256 _tokenId, bytes _data) external returns(bytes4);
    }

The standard mandates that the first parameter will be the operator - the caller of safeTransferFrom. The enforcer passes instead the `address(this)` value, in other words the Holographer address. The impact is that any bookkeeping done in target contract, and allow / disallow decision of the transaction, is based on false information.

### [](#impact-6)Impact

ERC721 transferFrom’s “to” contract may fail to accept transfers, or record credit of transfers incorrectly.

### [](#recommended-mitigation-steps-11)Recommended Mitigation Steps

Pass the msg.sender parameter, as the ERC721 standard requires.

ETH can be sent when calling the `HolographOperator` contract’s `executeJob` function, which can execute the following code.

    File: contracts\HolographOperator.sol
    419:     try
    420:       HolographOperatorInterface(address(this)).nonRevertingBridgeCall{value: msg.value}(
    421:         msg.sender,
    422:         bridgeInRequestPayload
    423:       )
    424:     {
    425:       /// @dev do nothing
    426:     } catch {
    427:       _failedJobs[hash] = true;
    428:       emit FailedOperatorJob(hash);
    429:     }

Executing the `try ... {...} catch {...}` code mentioned above will execute `HolographOperatorInterface(address(this)).nonRevertingBridgeCall{value: msg.value}(...)`. Calling the `nonRevertingBridgeCall` function can possibly execute `revert(0, 0)` if the external call to the bridge contract is not successful. When this occurs, the code in the `catch` block of the `try ... {...} catch {...}` code mentioned above will run, which does not make calling the `executeJob` function revert. As a result, even though the job is not successfully executed, the sent ETH is locked in the `HolographOperator` contract since there is no other way to transfer such sent ETH out from this contract. In this situation, the operator that calls the `executeJob` function will lose the sent ETH.

[HolographOperator.sol#L491-L511](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-10-holograph/blob/f8c2eae866280a1acfdc8a8352401ed031be1373/contracts/HolographOperator.sol#L491-L511)  

Using `block.number` and `block.timestamp` as a source of randomness is commonly advised against, as the outcome can be manipulated by calling contracts. In this case a compromised layer-zero-endpoint would be able to retry the selection of the primary operator until the result is favorable to the malicious actor.

### [](#proof-of-concept-7)Proof of Concept

An attack path for rerolling the result of bad randomness might look roughly like this:

    function attack(uint256 currentNonce, uint256 wantedPodIndex, uint256 numPods, uint256 wantedOperatorIndex, uint256 numOperators,  bytes calldata bridgeInRequestPayload) external{
    
        bytes32 jobHash = keccak256(bridgeInRequestPayload);
    
        //same calculation as in HolographOperator.crossChainMessage
        uint256 random = uint256(keccak256(abi.encodePacked(jobHash, currentNonce, block.number, block.timestamp)));
    
        require(wantedPodIndex == random % numPods)
        require(wantedOperatorIndex == random % numOperators);
    
        operator.crossChainMessage(bridgeInRequestPayload);
    }

The attack basically consists of repeatedly calling the `attack` function with data that is known and output that is wished for until the results match and only then continuing to calling the operator.

### [](#recommended-mitigation-steps-13)Recommended Mitigation Steps

Consider using a decentralized oracle for the generation of random numbers, such as [Chainlinks VRF](https://docs.chain.link/docs/vrf/v2/introduction/).

It should be noted, that in this case there is a prerequirement of the layer-zero endpoint being compromised, which confines the risk quite a bit, so using a normally unrecommended source of randomness could be acceptable here, considering the tradeoffs of integrating a decentralized oracle.

Operators are organized into different pod tiers. Every time a new request arrives, it is scheduled to a random available pod. It is important to note that pods may be empty, in which case the pod array actually has a single zero element to help with all sorts of bugs. When a pod of a non existing tier is created, any intermediate tiers between the current highest tier to the new tier are filled with zero elements. This happens at bondUtilityToken():

    if (_operatorPods.length < pod) {
      /**
       * @dev activate pod(s) up until the selected pod
       */
      for (uint256 i = _operatorPods.length; i <= pod; i++) {
        /**
         * @dev add zero address into pod to mitigate empty pod issues
         */
        _operatorPods.push([address(0)]);
      }
    }

The issue is that any user can spam the contract with a large amount of empty operator pods. The attack would look like this:

1.  bondUtilityToken(attacker, large_amount, high_pod\_number)
2.  unbondUtilityToken(attacker, attacker)

The above could be wrapped in a flashloan to get virtually any pod tier filled.

The consequence is that when the scheduler chooses pods uniformally, they will very likely choose an empty pod, with the zero address. Therefore, the chosen operator will be 0, which is referred to in the code as “open season”. In this occurrance, any operator can perform the executeJob() call. This is of course really bad, because all but one operator continually waste gas for executions that will be reverted after the lucky first transaction goes through. This would be a practical example of a griefing attack on Holograph.

### [](#impact-7)Impact

Any user can force chaotic “open season” operator behavior

### [](#recommended-mitigation-steps-14)Recommended Mitigation Steps

It is important to pay special attention to the scheduling algorithm, to make sure different pods are given execution time according to the desired heuristics.

[PA1D.sol#L391](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-10-holograph/blob/f8c2eae866280a1acfdc8a8352401ed031be1373/contracts/enforcer/PA1D.sol#L391)  
[PA1D.sol#L395](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-10-holograph/blob/f8c2eae866280a1acfdc8a8352401ed031be1373/contracts/enforcer/PA1D.sol#L395)  

Payout recipients can call `getEthPayout()` to transfer the ETH balance of the contract to all payout recipients.  
This function makes an internal call to `_payoutEth`, which sends the payment to the recipients based on their associated `bp`.

The issue is that the `balance` used in the `transfer` calls is not the contract ETH balance, but the balance minus a `gasCost`.

This means `getEthPayout()` calls will leave dust in the contract.

### [](#impact-8)Impact

If the dust is small enough, a subsequent call to `getEthPayout` is likely to revert because of [this check](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-10-holograph/blob/f8c2eae866280a1acfdc8a8352401ed031be1373/contracts/enforcer/PA1D.sol#L390).  
And `enforcer/PA1D` does not have any other ETH withdrawal function. While `enforcer/PA1D` is meant to be used via delegate calls from a NFT collection contract, if the NFT contract does not have any withdrawal function either, this dust mentioned above is effectively lost.

### [](#proof-of-concept-8)Proof of Concept

Let us take the example of a payout recipient trying to retrieve their share of the balance, equal to `40_000` For simplicity, assume one payout address, owned by Alice:

*   Alice calls `getEthPayout()`, which in turn calls `_payoutEth()`
*   `gasCost = (23300 * length) + length = 23300 + 1 = 23301`
*   `balance = address(this).balance = 40000`
*   `balance - gasCost = 40000 - 23301 = 16699`,
*   `sending = ((bps[i] * balance) / 10000) = 10000 * 16699 / 10000 = 16699`
*   Alice receives `16699`.

Alice has to wait for the balance to increase to call `getEthPayout()` again. But no matter what, there will always be at least a dust of `10000` left in the contract.

### [](#recommended-mitigation-steps-15)Recommended Mitigation Steps

The transfers should be done based on `address(this).balance`. The `gasCost` is redundant as the gas amount is specified by the caller of `getEthPayout()`, the contract does not have to provide gas.

    -391: balance = balance - gasCost;
    392:     uint256 sending;
    393:     // uint256 sent;
    394:     for (uint256 i = 0; i < length; i++) {
    395:       sending = ((bps[i] * balance) / 10000);
    396:       addresses[i].transfer(sending);
    397:       // sent = sent + sending;
    398:     }

[HolographERC20.sol#L539](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-10-holograph/blob/f8c2eae866280a1acfdc8a8352401ed031be1373/contracts/enforcer/HolographERC20.sol#L539)  

HolographERC20 is the ERC20 enforcer for Holograph. In the safeTransferFrom operation, it calls \_checkOnERC20Received:

    if (_isEventRegistered(HolographERC20Event.beforeSafeTransfer)) {
      require(SourceERC20().beforeSafeTransfer(account, recipient, amount, data));
    }
    _transfer(account, recipient, amount);
    require(_checkOnERC20Received(account, recipient, amount, data), "ERC20: non ERC20Receiver");
    if (_isEventRegistered(HolographERC20Event.afterSafeTransfer)) {
      require(SourceERC20().afterSafeTransfer(account, recipient, amount, data));
    }

The checkOnERC20Received function:

    if (_isContract(recipient)) {
      try ERC165(recipient).supportsInterface(ERC165.supportsInterface.selector) returns (bool erc165support) {
        require(erc165support, "ERC20: no ERC165 support");
        // we have erc165 support
        if (ERC165(recipient).supportsInterface(0x534f5876)) {
          // we have eip-4524 support
          try ERC20Receiver(recipient).onERC20Received(address(this), account, amount, data) returns (bytes4 retv
            return retval == ERC20Receiver.onERC20Received.selector;
          } catch (bytes memory reason) {
            if (reason.length == 0) {
              revert("ERC20: non ERC20Receiver");
            } else {
              assembly {
                revert(add(32, reason), mload(reason))
              }
            }
          }
        } else {
          revert("ERC20: eip-4524 not supported");
        }
      } catch (bytes memory reason) {
        if (reason.length == 0) {
          revert("ERC20: no ERC165 support");
        } else {
          assembly {
            revert(add(32, reason), mload(reason))
          }
        }
      }
    } else {
      return true;
    }

In essence, if the target is a contract, the enforcer requires it to fully implement EIP-4524. The problem is that [this](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4524) EIP is just a draft proposal, which the project cannot assume to be supported by any receiver contract, and definitely not every receiver contract.

The specs warn us:

    ⚠️ This EIP is not recommended for general use or implementation as it is likely to change.

Therefore, it is a very dangerous requirement to add in an ERC20 enforcer, and must be left to the implementation to do if it so desires.

### [](#impact-9)Impact

ERC20s enforced by HolographERC20 are completely uncomposable. They cannot be used for almost any DeFi application, making it basically useless.

### [](#recommended-mitigation-steps-16)Recommended Mitigation Steps

Remove the EIP-4524 requirements altogether.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

_Submitted by securerodd_

When new holographable tokens are created, they typically set a state variable that holds the address of the holograph contract. When creation is done through the `HolographFactory`, the holograph contract is [passed in as a parameter](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-10-holograph/blob/f8c2eae866280a1acfdc8a8352401ed031be1373/contracts/HolographFactory.sol#L252) to the holographable contract’s initializer function. Under normal circumstances, this would ensure that the hologrpahable asset stores a trusted holograph contract address in its `_holographSlot`.

However, the initializer is vulnerable to reentrancy and the `_holographSlot` can be set to an untrusted contract address. This occurs because before the initialization is complete, the Holographer makes a [delegate call](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-10-holograph/blob/f8c2eae866280a1acfdc8a8352401ed031be1373/contracts/enforcer/Holographer.sol#L162-L164) to a corresponding enforcer contract. From here, the enforcer contract makes an [optional call](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-10-holograph/blob/f8c2eae866280a1acfdc8a8352401ed031be1373/contracts/enforcer/HolographERC20.sol#L241) to the source contract in an attempt to intialize it. This call can be used to reenter into the Holographer contract’s initialize function before the first one has been completed and overwrite key variables such as the `_adminslot`, the `_holographSlot` and the `_sourceContractSlot`.

One way in which this becomes problematic is because of how holographed ERC20s perform `transferFrom` calls. Holographed ERC20s by default allow two special addresses to [transfer](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-10-holograph/blob/f8c2eae866280a1acfdc8a8352401ed031be1373/contracts/enforcer/HolographERC20.sol#L527) assets on behalf of other users without an allowance. These addresses are calculated by calling `_holograph().getBridge()` and `_holograph().getOperator()` respectively. With the above described reentrancy issue, `_holograph().getBridge()` and `_holograph().getOperator()` can return arbitrary addresses. This means that newly created holographed ERC20 tokens can be prone to unauthorized transfers. These assets will have been deployed by the HolographFactory and may look and feel like a safe holographable token to users but they can come with a built-in rugpull vector.

### [](#recommended-mitigation-steps-17)Recommended Mitigation Steps

Consider checking whether the contract is in an “initializing” phase such as is done in OpenZeppelin’s [`Initializable`](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/a1948250ab8c441f6d327a65754cb20d2b1b4554/contracts/proxy/utils/Initializable.sol#L83) library to prevent reentrancy during initialization. Additionally, if the bridge and operators are not intended to transfer tokens directly, consider removing the logic that allows them to bypass the allowance requirements.

A source contract can burn and transfer NFTs of users without their permission.

### [](#proof-of-concept-10)Proof of Concept

Every Holographed ERC721 collection is paired with a source contract, which is the user created contract that’s extended by the Holographed ERC721 contract ([HolographFactory.sol#L234-L246](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-10-holograph/blob/f8c2eae866280a1acfdc8a8352401ed031be1373/contracts/HolographFactory.sol#L234-L246)). A source contract, however, has excessive privileges in the Holographed ERC721. Specifically, it can burn and transfer users’ NFTs without their approval ([HolographERC721.sol#L500](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-10-holograph/blob/f8c2eae866280a1acfdc8a8352401ed031be1373/contracts/enforcer/HolographERC721.sol#L500), [HolographERC721.sol#L577](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-10-holograph/blob/f8c2eae866280a1acfdc8a8352401ed031be1373/contracts/enforcer/HolographERC721.sol#L577)):

    function sourceBurn(uint256 tokenId) external onlySource {
      address wallet = _tokenOwner[tokenId];
      _burn(wallet, tokenId);
    }
    
    function sourceTransfer(address to, uint256 tokenId) external onlySource {
      address wallet = _tokenOwner[tokenId];
      _transferFrom(wallet, to, tokenId);
    }

While this might be desirable for extensibility and flexibility, this puts users at the risk of being robbed by the source contract owner or a hacker who hacked the source contract owner’s key.

### [](#recommended-mitigation-steps-18)Recommended Mitigation Steps

Consider removing the `sourceBurn` and `sourceTransfer` functions of `HolographERC721` and requiring user approval to transfer or burn their tokens (`burn` and `safeTransferFrom` can be called by a source contract instead of `sourceBurn` and `sourceTransfer`).

Bond tokens (HLG) equal to the slash amount will get permanently stuck in the HolographOperator each time a job gets executed by someone who is not an (fallback-)operator.

### [](#proof-of-concept-11)Proof of Concept

The `HolographOperator.executeJob` function can be executed by anyone after a certain passage of time:

    ...
    if (job.operator != address(0)) {
        ...
        if (job.operator != msg.sender) {
            //perform time and gas price check
            if (timeDifference < 6) {
                // check msg.sender == correct fallback operator
            }
            // slash primary operator
            uint256 amount = _getBaseBondAmount(pod);
            _bondedAmounts[job.operator] -= amount;
            _bondedAmounts[msg.sender] += amount;
    
            //determine if primary operator retains his job
            if (_bondedAmounts[job.operator] >= amount) {
                ...
            } else {
                ...
            }
        }
    }
    // execute the job

In case `if (timeDifference < 6) {` gets skipped, the slashed amount will be assigned to the `msg.sender` regardless if that sender is currently an operator or not. The problem lies within the fact that if `msg.sender` is not already an operator at the time of executing the job, he cannot become one after, to retrieve the reward he got for slashing the primary operator. This is because the function `HolographOperator.bondUtilityToken` requires `_bondedAmounts` to be 0 prior to bonding and hence becoming an operator:

    require(_bondedOperators[operator] == 0 && _bondedAmounts[operator] == 0, "HOLOGRAPH: operator is bonded");

### [](#recommended-mitigation-steps-19)Recommended Mitigation Steps

Assuming that it is intentional that non-operators can execute jobs (which could make sense, so that a user could finish a bridging process on his own, if none of the operators are doing it): remove the requirement that `_bondedAmounts` need to be 0 prior to bonding and becoming an operator so that non-operators can get access to the slashing reward by unbonding after.

Alternatively (possibly preferrable), just add a method to withdraw any `_bondedAmounts` of non-operators.

When user call unbondUtilityToken to unstake the token, the function reads the available bonded amount, and transfers back to the operator.

[https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-10-holograph/blob/f8c2eae866280a1acfdc8a8352401ed031be1373/contracts/HolographOperator.sol#L899](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-10-holograph/blob/f8c2eae866280a1acfdc8a8352401ed031be1373/contracts/HolographOperator.sol#L899)

    _popOperator(_bondedOperators[operator] - 1, _operatorPodIndex[operator]);
    /**
     * @dev transfer tokens to recipient
     */
    require(_utilityToken().transfer(recipient, amount), "HOLOGRAPH: token transfer failed");

the logic is clean, but does not conform to the buisness requirement in the documentation, the doc said

[https://docs.holograph.xyz/holograph-protocol/operator-network-specification#operator-job-selection](https://docs.holograph.xyz/holograph-protocol/operator-network-specification#operator-job-selection)

> To move to a different pod, an Operator must withdraw and re-bond HLG. Operators who withdraw HLG will be charged a 0.1% fee, the proceeds of which will be burned or returned to the Treasury.

The charge 0.1% fee is not implemented in the code.

there are two incentive for bounded operator to stay,

the first is the reward incentive, the second is to avoid penalty with unbonding.

Without chargin the unstaking fee, the second incentive is weak and the operator can unbound or bond whenver they want

`bidShares` returned are incorrect leading to incorrect royalties.

### [](#proof-of-concept-13)Proof of Concept

[Zora Market](https://etherscan.io/address/0xe5bfab544eca83849c53464f85b7164375bdaac1#code#F1#L113)

    function isValidBidShares(BidShares memory bidShares)
        public
        pure
        override
        returns (bool)
    {
        return
            bidShares.creator.value.add(bidShares.owner.value).add(
                bidShares.prevOwner.value
            ) == uint256(100).mul(Decimal.BASE);
    }

Above you can see the Zora market lines that validate bidShares, which shows that Zora market bidShare.values should be percentages written out to 18 decimals. However PA1D#bidSharesForToken sets the bidShares.creator.value to the raw basis points set by the owner, which is many order of magnitudes different than expected.

### [](#recommended-mitigation-steps-21)Recommended Mitigation Steps

To return the proper value, basis points returned need to be adjusted. Convert from basis points to percentage by dividing by 10 \*\* 2 (100) then scale to 18 decimals. The final result it to multiple the basis point by 10 \*\* (18 - 2) or 10 \*\* 16:

    function bidSharesForToken(uint256 tokenId) public view returns (ZoraBidShares memory bidShares) {
        // this information is outside of the scope of our
        bidShares.prevOwner.value = 0;
        bidShares.owner.value = 0;
        if (_getReceiver(tokenId) == address(0)) {
    -       bidShares.creator.value = _getDefaultBp();
    +       bidShares.creator.value = _getDefaultBp() * (10 ** 16);
        } else {
    -       bidShares.creator.value = _getBp(tokenId);
    +       bidShares.creator.value = _getBp(tokenId) * (10 ** 16);
        }
        return bidShares;
    }

[HolographERC721.sol#L366](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-10-holograph/blob/24bc4d8dfeb6e4328d2c6291d20553b1d3eff00b/src/enforcer/HolographERC721.sol#L366)  

According to EIP-721, we have the following for `safeTransferFrom`:

    ///  (...) When transfer is complete, this function
    ///  checks if `_to` is a smart contract (code size > 0). If so, it calls
    ///  `onERC721Received` on `_to` and throws if the return value is not
    ///  `bytes4(keccak256("onERC721Received(address,address,uint256,bytes)"))`.

According to the specification, the function must therefore always call `onERC721Received`, not only when it has determined via ERC-165 that the contract provides this function. Note that in the EIP, the provided interface for `ERC721TokenReceiver` does not mention ERC-165. For the token itself, we have: `interface ERC721 /* is ERC165 */ {`  
However, for the receiver, the provided interface there is just: `interface ERC721TokenReceiver {`  
This leads to failed transfers when they should not fail, because many receivers will just implement the `onERC721Received` function (which is sufficient according to the EIP), and not `supportsInterface` for ERC-165 support.

### [](#proof-of-concept-14)Proof Of Concept

Let’s say a receiver just implements the `IERC721Receiver` from OpenZeppelin: [https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC721/IERC721Receiver.sol](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC721/IERC721Receiver.sol)  
Like the provided interface in the EIP itself, this interface does not derive from EIP-165. All of these receivers (which are most receivers in practice) will not be able to receive those tokens, because the `require` statement (that checks for ERC-165 support) reverts.

### [](#recommended-mitigation-steps-22)Recommended Mitigation Steps

Remove the ERC-165 check in the `require` statement (like OpenZeppelin does: [https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC721/ERC721.sol#L436](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC721/ERC721.sol#L436)).

Wrong slashing calculation may create unfair punishment for operators that accidentally forgot to execute their job.

### [](#proof-of-concept-16)Proof of Concept

[Docs](https://docs.holograph.xyz/holograph-protocol/operator-network-specification): If an operator acts maliciously, a percentage of their bonded HLG will get slashed. Misbehavior includes (i) downtime, (ii) double-signing transactions, and (iii) abusing transaction speeds. 50% of the slashed HLG will be rewarded to the next operator to execute the transaction, and the remaining 50% will be burned or returned to the Treasury.

The docs also include a guide for the number of slashes and the percentage of bond slashed. However, in the contract, there is no slashing of percentage fees. Rather, the whole \_getBaseBondAmount() fee is [slashed from the job.operator instead.](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-10-holograph/blob/f8c2eae866280a1acfdc8a8352401ed031be1373/contracts/HolographOperator.sol#L374-L382)

            uint256 amount = _getBaseBondAmount(pod);
            /**
             * @dev select operator that failed to do the job, is slashed the pod base fee
             */
            _bondedAmounts[job.operator] -= amount;
            /**
             * @dev the slashed amount is sent to current operator
             */
            _bondedAmounts[msg.sender] += amount;

Documentation states that only a portion should be slashed and the number of slashes should be noted down.

### [](#recommended-mitigation-steps-24)Recommended Mitigation Steps

Implement the correct percentage of slashing and include a mapping to note down the number of slashes that an operator has.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[HolographERC721.sol#L962](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-10-holograph/blob/f8c2eae866280a1acfdc8a8352401ed031be1373/contracts/enforcer/HolographERC721.sol#L962)  

HolographERC721.sol is an enforcer of the ERC721 standard. In its fallback function, it calls the actual implementation in order to handle additional logic.

If Holographer is called with no calldata and some msg.value, the call will reach the receive() function, which does not forward the call down to the implementation.

This can be a serious value leak issue, because the underlying implementation may have valid behavior for handling sending of value. For example, it can mint the next available tokenID and credit it to the user. Since this logic is never reached, the entire msg.value is just leaked.

### [](#impact-10)Impact

Leak of value when interacting with an NFT using the receive() or fallback() callback. Note that if NFT implements fallback OR receive() function, execution will never reach either of them from the enforcer’s receive() function.

### [](#recommended-mitigation-steps-25)Recommended Mitigation Steps

Funnel receive() empty calls down to the implementation.

> This is intended behavior, `mgs.value` is never leaked directly to custom implementations. For ERC721 there is a direct and secure method of withdrawing that value via the PA1D contract logic.

**[Trust (warden) commented](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-10-holograph-findings/issues/468#issuecomment-1319747993):**

> Yeah, but the withdrawal in PA1D will split the money between payout addresses. If developer implemented an ERC721 with receive() fallback, this call would be intended for that logic but instead the money is now treated as royalties to payout.

**[ACC01ADE (Holograph) commented](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-10-holograph-findings/issues/468#issuecomment-1320921141):**

> Developer can implement custom payable functions that guarantee msg.value transfer to their custom implementation. Receive function is reserved for royalty payouts that directly send funds to contract address. Plus it’s expected to be limited to 21k gas units, so there is no real use case where any logic can be accomplished with that much gas.

**[ACC01ADE (Holograph) commented](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-10-holograph-findings/issues/468#issuecomment-1322294719):**

> That being said, this is a valid issue and sponsor confirms it. There is no clearly communicated code/documentation that explains this limitation to developers. Will make an attempt at mitigating this potential issue from happening on custom implementation side by providing clearer language and also adding revert functionality in the receive functions to get the attention of developers that might have missed this.

[HolographERC721.sol#L272](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-10-holograph/blob/24bc4d8dfeb6e4328d2c6291d20553b1d3eff00b/src/enforcer/HolographERC721.sol#L272)  

According to EIP-721, we have for `approve`:

    ///  Throws unless `msg.sender` is the current NFT owner, or an authorized
    ///  operator of the current owner.

An operator in the context of EIP-721 is someone who was approved via `setApprovalForAll`:

    /// @notice Enable or disable approval for a third party ("operator") to manage
    ///  all of `msg.sender`'s assets
    /// @dev Emits the ApprovalForAll event. The contract MUST allow
    ///  multiple operators per owner.
    /// @param _operator Address to add to the set of authorized operators
    /// @param _approved True if the operator is approved, false to revoke approval
    function setApprovalForAll(address _operator, bool _approved) external;

Besides operators, there are also approved addresses for a token (for which `approve` is used). However, approved addresses can only transfer the token, see for instance the `safeTransferFrom` description:

    /// @dev Throws unless `msg.sender` is the current owner, an authorized
    ///  operator, or the approved address for this NFT.

`HolographERC721` does not distinguish between authorized operators and approved addresses when it comes to the `approve` function. Because `_isApproved(msg.sender, tokenId)` is used there, an approved address can approve another address, which is a violation of the EIP (only authorized operators should be able to do so).

### [](#proof-of-concept-17)Proof Of Concept

Bob calls `approve` to approve Alice on token ID 42 (that is owned by Bob). One week later, Bob sees that a malicious address was approved for his token ID 42 (e.g., because Alice got phished) and stole his token. Bob wonders how this is possible, because Alice should not have the permission to approve other addresses. However, becaue `HolographERC721` did not follow EIP-721, it was possible.

### [](#recommended-mitigation-steps-26)Recommended Mitigation Steps

Follow the EIP, i.e. do not allow approved addresses to approve other addresses.

Both are related to ERC721 compliance, but they have different causes (wrong `safeTransferFrom` vs. wrong `approve`), very different impacts (failing transfers vs. unintended permissions), and the sponsor will implement different fixes for them (that for instance would not make sense to review together in a fix review)

Lack of zero-address validation on address parameters may lead to transaction reverts, waste gas, require resubmission of transactions and may even force contract redeployments in certain cases within the protocol.

### [](#recommended-mitigation-steps-27)Recommended Mitigation Steps

Consider adding explicit zero-address validation on input parameters of address type.

[](#02-use-safetransfer-instead-of-transfer)\[02\] Use `safetransfer` Instead Of `transfer`
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

It is good to add a `require()` statement that checks the return value of token transfers or to use something like OpenZeppelin’s `safeTransfer`/`safeTransferFrom` unless one is sure the given token reverts in case of a failure. Failure to do so will cause silent failures of transfers and affect token accounting in contract.

For example, Some tokens do not implement the ERC20 standard properly but are still accepted by most code that accepts ERC20 tokens. For example Tether (USDT)‘s transfer() and transferFrom() functions do not return booleans as the specification requires, and instead have no return value. When these sorts of tokens are cast to IERC20, their function signatures do not match and therefore the calls made, revert.

### [](#recommended-mitigation-steps-28)Recommended Mitigation Steps

Consider using `safeTransfer`/`safeTransferFrom` or `require()` consistently.

[](#03-unused-receive-function-will-lock-ether-in-contract)\[03\] Unused `receive()` Function Will Lock Ether In Contract
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If the intention is for the Ether to be used, the function should call another function, otherwise it should revert

### [](#recommended-mitigation-steps-29)Recommended Mitigation Steps

The function should call another function, otherwise it should revert

[](#04-use-_safemint-instead-of-_mint)\[04\] Use `_safeMint` instead of `_mint`
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

According to openzepplin’s ERC721, the use of `_mint` is discouraged, use _safeMint whenever possible.

[](#05-missing-contract-existence-checks-before-low-level-calls)\[05\] Missing Contract-existence Checks Before Low-level Calls
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Low-level calls return success if there is no code present at the specified address.

### [](#recommended-mitigation-steps-31)Recommended Mitigation Steps

In addition to the zero-address checks, add a check to verify that `<address>.code.length > 0`

[](#06-critical-changes-should-use-two-step-procedure)\[06\] Critical Changes Should Use Two-step Procedure

### [](#recommended-mitigation-steps-32)Recommended Mitigation Steps

Lack of two-step procedure for critical operations leaves them error-prone. Consider adding two step procedure on the critical functions.

### [](#recommended-mitigation-steps-34)Recommended Mitigation Steps

Using low-level `call.value(amount)` with the corresponding result check or using the OpenZeppelin `Address.sendValue` is advised:

[](#09-ecrecover-may-return-empty-address)\[09\] `ecrecover` may return empty address
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

There is a common issue that ecrecover returns empty (0x0) address when the signature is invalid. function `_verifySigner` should check that before returning the result of ecrecover.

### [](#recommended-mitigation-steps-35)Recommended Mitigation Steps

See the solution here: [https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/v3.4.0/contracts/cryptography/ECDSA.sol#L68](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/v3.4.0/contracts/cryptography/ECDSA.sol#L68)

[](#10-holographfactorydeployholographablecontract-can-overpopulate-holographregistry_holographablecontracts)\[10\] `HolographFactory.deployHolographableContract()` can overpopulate `HolographRegistry._holographableContracts`
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The `require` checks in `HolographFactory.deployHolographableContract()` can easily by bypassed by sending an invalid signature and `signer` = 0x0.

As a result, this will deploy a holographableContract and update the `HolographRegistry` and push an additional item to `HolographRegistry._holographableContracts`.

Due to `_holographableContracts.push(contractAddress);` in `HolographRegistryInterface(registry).setHolographedHashAddress(hash, holographerAddress);`

A malicious user can overpopulate the `_holographableContracts` array with redundant data, increasing gas costs when `_holographableContracts` is iterated through.

### [](#recommended-mitigation-steps-36)Recommended Mitigation Steps

Implement valid access control on the `HolographFactory.deployHolographableContract()` to ensure only the relevant can deploy

[](#11-event-is-missing-indexed-fields)\[11\] Event Is Missing Indexed Fields
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Index event fields make the field more quickly accessible to off-chain tools that parse events. However, note that each index field costs extra gas during emission, so it’s not necessarily best to index the maximum allowed per event (three fields).

Each event should use three indexed fields if there are three or more fields, and gas usage is not particularly of concern for the events in question. If there are fewer than three fields, all of the fields should be indexed.

[](#12-public-functions-not-called-by-the-contract-should-be-declared-external-instead)\[12\] Public Functions Not Called By The Contract Should Be Declared External Instead

[](#17-large-multiples-of-ten-should-use-scientific-notation)\[17\]\] Large multiples of ten should use scientific notation
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Use (e.g. 1e6) rather than decimal literals (e.g. 100000), for better code readability.

[](#18-use-of-blocktimestamp)\[18\] Use of Block.Timestamp
----------------------------------------------------------

Block timestamps have historically been used for a variety of applications, such as entropy for random numbers (see the Entropy Illusion for further details), locking funds for periods of time, and various state-changing conditional statements that are time-dependent. Miners have the ability to adjust timestamps slightly, which can prove to be dangerous if block timestamps are used incorrectly in smart contracts. References: SWC ID: 116

### [](#recommended-mitigation-steps-37)Recommended Mitigation Steps

Block timestamps should not be used for entropy or generating random numbers—i.e., they should not be the deciding factor (either directly or through some derivation) for winning a game or changing an important state.

Time-sensitive logic is sometimes required; e.g., for unlocking contracts (time-locking), completing an ICO after a few weeks, or enforcing expiry dates. It is sometimes recommended to use block.number and an average block time to estimate times; with a 10 second block time, 1 week equates to approximately, 60480 blocks. Thus, specifying a block number at which to change a contract state can be more secure, as miners are unable to easily manipulate the block number.

[](#19-non-usage-of-specific-imports)\[19\] Non-usage of specific imports
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

The current form of relative path import is not recommended for use because it can unpredictably pollute the namespace.  
Instead, the Solidity docs recommend specifying imported symbols explicitly.  
[https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.15/layout-of-source-files.html#importing-other-source-files](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.15/layout-of-source-files.html#importing-other-source-files)

### [](#recommended-mitigation-steps-38)Recommended Mitigation Steps

Use specific imports syntax per solidity docs recommendation.

[](#20-lines-are-too-long)\[20\] Lines are too long
---------------------------------------------------

Usually lines in source code are limited to 80 characters. Today’s screens are much larger so it’s reasonable to stretch this in some cases. Since the files will most likely reside in GitHub, and GitHub starts using a scroll bar in all cases when the length is over 164 characters, the lines below should be split when they reach that length Reference: [https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.10/style-guide.html#maximum-line-length](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.10/style-guide.html#maximum-line-length)

[](#21-use-bytesconcat)\[21\] Use `bytes.concat()`
--------------------------------------------------

Solidity version 0.8.4 introduces `bytes.concat()` (vs `abi.encodePacked(<bytes>,<bytes>)`)

### [](#recommended-mitigation-steps-39)Recommended Mitigation Steps

Use `bytes.concat()` and upgrade to at least Solidity version 0.8.4 if required.

[](#22-use-of-ecrecover-is-susceptible-to-signature-malleability)\[22\] Use of `ecrecover` is susceptible to signature malleability
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The built-in EVM precompile `ecrecover` is susceptible to signature malleability, which could lead to replay attacks.  
References: [https://swcregistry.io/docs/SWC-117](https://swcregistry.io/docs/SWC-117), [https://swcregistry.io/docs/SWC-121](https://swcregistry.io/docs/SWC-121), and [https://medium.com/cryptronics/signature-replay-vulnerabilities-in-smart-contracts-3b6f7596df57.](https://medium.com/cryptronics/signature-replay-vulnerabilities-in-smart-contracts-3b6f7596df57.)  
While this is not immediately exploitable, this may become a vulnerability if used elsewhere.

### [](#recommended-mitigation-steps-40)Recommended Mitigation Steps

Consider using OpenZeppelin’s ECDSA library (which prevents this malleability) instead of the built-in function.

If a function modifier such as onlyOwner is used, the function will revert if a normal user tries to pay the function.

When using elements that are smaller than 32 bytes, your contract’s gas usage may be higher. This is because the EVM operates on 32 bytes at a time. Therefore, if the element is smaller than that, the EVM must use more operations in order to reduce the size of the element from 32 bytes to the desired size.

Booleans are more expensive than uint256 or any type that takes up a full word because each write operation emits an extra SLOAD to first read the slot’s contents, replace the bits taken up by the boolean, and then write back. This is the compiler’s defense against contract upgrades and pointer aliasing, and it cannot be disabled. Use uint256(1) and uint256(2) for true/false instead

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Saves a storage slot for the mapping. Depending on the circumstances and sizes of types, can avoid a Gsset (20000 gas) per mapping combined. Reads and subsequent writes can also be cheaper when a function requires both values and they both fit in the same storage slot. Finally, if both fields are accessed in the same function, can save ~42 gas per access due to not having to recalculate the key’s keccak256 hash (Gkeccak256 - 30 gas) and that calculation’s associated stack operations.

[](#g-22-using-storage-instead-of-memory-for-structsarrays-saves-gas)\[G-22\] Using storage instead of memory for structs/arrays saves gas
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When fetching data from a storage location, assigning the data to a memory variable causes all fields of the struct/array to be read from storage, which incurs a Gcoldsload (2100 gas) for each field of the struct/array. If the fields are read from the new memory variable, they incur an additional MLOAD rather than a cheap stack read.

Instead of declearing the variable with the memory keyword, declaring the variable with the storage keyword and caching any fields that need to be re-read in stack variables, will be much cheaper, only incuring the Gcoldsload for the fields actually read. The only time it makes sense to read the whole struct/array into a memory variable, is if the full struct/array is being returned by the function, is being passed to a function that requires memory, or if the array/struct is being read from another memory array/struct
