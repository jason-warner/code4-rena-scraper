[](#about-c4)About C4
---------------------

Code4rena (C4) is an open organization consisting of security researchers, auditors, developers, and individuals with domain expertise in smart contracts.

A C4 audit contest is an event in which community participants, referred to as Wardens, review, audit, or analyze smart contract logic in exchange for a bounty provided by sponsoring projects.

During the audit contest outlined in this document, C4 conducted an analysis of the Foundation Drop smart contract system written in Solidity. The audit contest took place between August 11—August 15 2022.

This contest was judged by [hickuphh3](https://github.com/HickupHH3).

Final report assembled by [itsmetechjay](https://twitter.com/itsmetechjay).

[](#summary)Summary
===================

The C4 analysis yielded an aggregated total of 8 unique vulnerabilities. Of these vulnerabilities, 0 received a risk rating in the category of HIGH severity and 8 received a risk rating in the category of MEDIUM severity.

Additionally, C4 analysis included 73 reports detailing issues with a risk rating of LOW severity or non-critical. There were also 73 reports recommending gas optimizations.

All of the issues presented here are linked back to their original finding.

[](#scope)Scope
===============

The code under review can be found within the [C4 Foundation Drop contest repository](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-foundation), and is composed of 20 smart contracts written in the Solidity programming language and includes 1,218 lines of Solidity code.

[](#severity-criteria)Severity Criteria
=======================================

C4 assesses the severity of disclosed vulnerabilities according to a methodology based on [OWASP standards](https://owasp.org/www-community/OWASP_Risk_Rating_Methodology).

Vulnerabilities are divided into three primary risk categories: high, medium, and low/non-critical.

High-level considerations for vulnerabilities span the following key areas when conducting assessments:

*   Malicious Input Handling
*   Escalation of privileges
*   Arithmetic
*   Gas use

Further information regarding the severity criteria referenced throughout the submission review process, please refer to the documentation provided on [the C4 website](https://code4rena.com).

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

_Submitted by Lambda_

`royaltyInfo`, `getRoyalties`, or `getFeeRecipients` may return `address(0)` as the recipient address. While the value 0 is correctly handled for the royalties itself, it is not for the address. In such a case, the ETH amount will be sent to `address(0)`, i.e. it is burned and lost.

### [](#recommended-mitigation-steps)Recommended Mitigation Steps

In your logic for determining the recipients, treat `address(0)` as if no recipient was returned such that the other priorities / methods take over.

**[HardlyDifficult (Foundation) confirmed, but disagreed with severity and commented](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-foundation-findings/issues/31#issuecomment-1220570897):**

> We are looking into options here to improve.
> 
> We believe this is Medium risk, burning a percent of the sale revenue is a form of leaking value. Otherwise the sale works as expected and the collector does get the NFT they purchased.
> 
> The royalty APIs we use are meant to specific which addresses should receive payments and how much they each should receive. As the warden noted, we try to ignore entries which specify a 0 amount… but did not filter out address(0) recipients with >0 requested. Originally we were thinking this was a way of requesting that a portion of the sale be burned since that seems to be what the data is proposing.
> 
> However we agree that this is more likely a configuration error. Since our market uses ETH and not ERC20 tokens, it’s unlikely that creators would actually want a portion of the proceeds burned. We are exploring a change to send the additional revenue to the seller instead of burning the funds in this scenario.

**[HickupHH3 (judge) decreased severity to Medium and commented](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-foundation-findings/issues/31#issuecomment-1226890842):**

> Case of protocol leaked value: Medium severity is appropriate.

Selling a NFT with `NFTDropMarketFixedPriceSale.mintFromFixedPriceSale` distributes the revenue from the sale to various recipients with the `MarketFees._distributeFunds` function.

Recipients:

*   NFT creator(s)
*   NFT seller
*   Protocol
*   Buy referrer (optional)

It is possible to have multiple NFT creators. Sale revenue will be distributed to each NFT creator address. Revenue distribution is done by calling `SendValueWithFallbackWithdraw._sendValueWithFallbackWithdraw` and providing an appropriate gas limit to prevent consuming too much gas. For the revenue distribution to the seller, protocol and the buy referrer, a gas limit of `SEND_VALUE_GAS_LIMIT_SINGLE_RECIPIENT = 20_000` is used. However, for the creators, a limit of `SEND_VALUE_GAS_LIMIT_MULTIPLE_RECIPIENTS = 210_000` is used. This higher amount of gas is used if `PercentSplitETH` is used as a recipient.

A maximum of `MAX_ROYALTY_RECIPIENTS = 5` NFT creator recipients are allowed.

For example, a once honest NFT collection and its 5 royalty creator recipients could turn “malicious” and could “steal” gas from NFT buyers on each NFT sale and therefore grief NFT sales. On each NFT sell, the 5 creator recipients (smart contracts) could consume the full amount of `SEND_VALUE_GAS_LIMIT_MULTIPLE_RECIPIENTS = 210_000` forwarded gas. Totalling `5 * 210_000 = 1_050_000` gas. With a gas price of e.g. `20 gwei`, this equals to additional gas costs of `21_000_000 gwei = 0.028156 eth`, with a `ETH` price of `2000`, this would total to ~`56.31 $` additional costs.

> This seems like a Low risk issue since only gas is at risk, but protecting our collectors is an important goal so we are comfortable with Medium here.

> 
> The gas limits we set are high enough to allow some custom logic to be performed, and to support smart contract wallets such as Gnosis Safe. For the scenario highlighted here, we have used a very high limit in order to work with contracts such as PercentSplitETH (which will push payments to up to 5 different recipients, and those recipients may be smart contract wallets themselves).
> 
> However we were too flexible here. And in total, the max potential gas costs are higher than they should be. We have changed the logic to only use `SEND_VALUE_GAS_LIMIT_MULTIPLE_RECIPIENTS` when 1 recipient is defined, otherwise use `SEND_VALUE_GAS_LIMIT_SINGLE_RECIPIENT`. This will support our PercentSplitETH scenario and use cases like it, while restricting the worst case scenario to something much more reasonable.

Wrong return of `cretorShares` and `creatorRecipients` can make real royalties party can’t gain the revenue of sale.

### [](#proof-of-concept-1)Proof of concept

Function `getFees()` firstly [call](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-foundation/blob/792e00df429b0df9ee5d909a0a5a6e72bd07cf79/contracts/mixins/shared/MarketFees.sol#L422-L430) to function `internalGetImmutableRoyalties` to get the list of `creatorRecipients` and `creatorShares` if the `nftContract` define ERC2981 royalties.

    try implementationAddress.internalGetImmutableRoyalties(nftContract, tokenId) returns (
      address payable[] memory _recipients,
      uint256[] memory _splitPerRecipientInBasisPoints
    ) {
      (creatorRecipients, creatorShares) = (_recipients, _splitPerRecipientInBasisPoints);
    } catch // solhint-disable-next-line no-empty-blocks
    {
      // Fall through
    }

* * *

In the [1st priority](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-foundation/blob/792e00df429b0df9ee5d909a0a5a6e72bd07cf79/contracts/mixins/shared/MarketFees.sol#L236-L255) it check the `nftContract` define the function `royaltyInfo` or not. If yes, it get the return value `receiver` and `royaltyAmount`. In some manifold contracts of erc2981, it `return (address(this), 0)` when royalties are not defined. So we ignore it when the `royaltyAmount = 0`

      try IRoyaltyInfo(nftContract).royaltyInfo{ gas: READ_ONLY_GAS_LIMIT }(tokenId, BASIS_POINTS) returns (
        address receiver,
        uint256 royaltyAmount
      ) {
        // Manifold contracts return (address(this), 0) when royalties are not defined
        // - so ignore results when the amount is 0
        if (royaltyAmount > 0) {
          recipients = new address payable[](1);
          recipients[0] = payable(receiver);
          splitPerRecipientInBasisPoints = new uint256[](1);
          // The split amount is assumed to be 100% when only 1 recipient is returned
          return (recipients, splitPerRecipientInBasisPoints);
        }

* * *

In the same sense, the [3rd priority](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-foundation/blob/792e00df429b0df9ee5d909a0a5a6e72bd07cf79/contracts/mixins/shared/MarketFees.sol#L297-L312) (it can reach to 3rd priority when function `internalGetImmutableRoyalies` fail to return some royalties) should check same as the 1st priority with the `royaltyRegistry.getRoyaltyLookupAddress`. But the 3rd priority forget to check the case when `royaltyAmount == 0`.

It will make [function](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-foundation/blob/792e00df429b0df9ee5d909a0a5a6e72bd07cf79/contracts/mixins/shared/MarketFees.sol#L98) `_distributeFunds()` transfer to the wrong `creatorRecipients` (for example erc2981 return `(address(this), 0)`, market will transfer creator revenue to `address(this)` - market contract, and make the fund freeze in contract forever).

This case just happen when

*   `nftContract` doesn’t have any support for royalties info
*   `overrideContract` which was fetched from`royaltyRegistry.getRoyaltyLookupAddress(nftContract)` implements both function `getRoyalties` and `royaltyInfo` but doesn’t support `royaltyInfo` by returning `(address(this), 0)`.

It is possible to bypass the `saleConfig.limitPerAccount` set by the creator by transferring the NFTs out. For highly sought after NFT drops, a single smart contract can buy out the entire drop simply by calling `mintFromFixedPriceSale` then transferring the NFTs out and repeating the process multiple times.

> This is accurate! We had several meetings about this concern while building the contract, ultimately deciding to move forward with this approach knowing that it has limitations. The trouble is every limit solution suggested and used in the wild today can be gamed, it’s just varying levels of friction for an attacker to work around it. Once someone has coded up a workaround, it could easily be used on any of the collections being sold by our marketplace. So we decided to KISS.

For example, the creator could create a new collection to replace the original - airdropping NFTs to their legit holders, or allowing them to do an NFT swap (so the original collection can slowly be removed from circulation) — this swap could also have a deny list so that the abused sales cannot be used to redeem from the new collection, and presumably the original collection will quickly lose value so long as the creator’s community is on board with this process. Or the creator and their community could choose to simply accept that the sale went down this way and wait for things to balance out again on the secondary market.

If one creator specified a share that is larger than `BASIS_POINTS`, the first creator gets all of the royalties. Depending on how these are set (which is not in the control of the project), this can be exploited by the first creator.

### [](#proof-of-concept-3)Proof Of Concept

A collective of artists have implemented a process where everyone can set its own share of the fees to the value that he thinks is fair and these values are returned by `getRoyalties`. Bob, the first entry in the list of `_recipients` sets its value to a value that is slightly larger than `BASIS_POINTS` such that he gets all of the royalties.

### [](#recommended-mitigation-steps-4)Recommended Mitigation Steps

There is no need for this check / logic, as the whole sum (`totalShares`) is used anyway to normalize the values.

In the case of a fixed price sale where `nftContract` is a custom NFT contract that adheres to `INFTDropCollectionMint`, a malicious creator can set a malicious implementation of `INFTDropCollectionMint.mintCountTo()` that would result in collectors calling this function losing funds without receiving the expected amount of NFTs.

### [](#proof-of-concept-4)Proof Of Concept

Here is a [Foundry test](https://gist.github.com/joestakey/4b13c7ae6029332da6eaf63b9d2a38bd) that shows a fixed price sale with a malicious NFT contract, where a collector pays for 10 NFTs while only receiving one. It can be described as follow:

*   A creator creates a malicious `nftContract` with `mintCountTo` minting only one NFT per call, regardless of the value of `count`
*   The creator calls `NFTDropMarketFixedPriceSale.createFixedPriceSale()` to create a sale for `nftContract`, with `limit` set to `15`.
*   Bob is monitoring the `CreateFixedPriceSale` event. Upon noticing `CreateFixedPriceSale(customERC721, Alice, price, limit)`, he calls `NFTDropMarketFixedPriceSale.mintFromFixedPriceSale(customERC721, count == 10,)`. He pays the price of `count = 10` NFTs, but because of the logic in `mintCountTo`, only receives one NFT.

Note that `mintCountTo` can be implemented in many malicious ways, this is only one example. Another implementation could simply return `firstTokenId` without performing any minting.

### [](#tools-used-1)Tools Used

### [](#recommended-mitigation-steps-5)Recommended Mitigation Steps

The problem here lies in the implementation of `INFTDropCollectionMint(nftContract).mintCountTo()`. You could add an additional check in `NFTDropMarketFixedPriceSale.mintCountTo()` using `ERC721(nftContract).balanceOf()`.

    + uint256 balanceBefore = IERC721(nftContract).balanceOf(msg.sender);
    207:     firstTokenId = INFTDropCollectionMint(nftContract).mintCountTo(count, msg.sender);

    + require(balanceAfter == balanceBefore + count, "minting failed")

If such receiver is a contract that does not support the ERC721 protocol, the NFT will be locked and cannot be retrieved.

### [](#proof-of-concept-5)Proof of Concept

The following steps can occur when minting an NFT of a NFT collection or NFT drop collection.

1.  The [`_mint`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-foundation/blob/main/contracts/NFTCollection.sol#L262-L274) or [`mintCountTo`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-foundation/blob/main/contracts/NFTDropCollection.sol#L171-L187) function is called with `msg.sender` or the `to` input corresponding to a contract.
2.  The OpenZeppelin’s `ERC721Upgradeable` contract’s [`_mint`](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts-upgradeable/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC721/ERC721Upgradeable.sol#L284-L296) function is called with `msg.sender` or `to` used in Step 1 as the receiver address.
3.  Since calling the OpenZeppelin’s `ERC721Upgradeable` contract’s [`_mint`](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts-upgradeable/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC721/ERC721Upgradeable.sol#L284-L296) function does not execute the same contract’s [`_checkOnERC721Received`](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts-upgradeable/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC721/ERC721Upgradeable.sol#L400-L422) function, it is unknown if the receiving contract inherits from the `IERC721ReceiverUpgradeable` interface and implements the `onERC721Received` function or not. It is possible that the receiving contract does not support the ERC721 protocol, which causes the minted NFT to be locked.

`NFTDropMarketFixedPriceSale.createFixedPriceSale` allows creators to create a sale drop. A creator can create a drop sale for their custom NFT Contract that adheres to `INFTDropCollectionMint`.

`INFTDropCollectionMint.mintCountTo` must return the `firstTokenId` being minted, but it is not clear as to what should be returned upon all tokens being minted. A valid implementation could for instance return `0` if called after the last token has been minted.

But the drop market [expects the call to mintCountTo](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-foundation/blob/792e00df429b0df9ee5d909a0a5a6e72bd07cf79/contracts/mixins/nftDropMarket/NFTDropMarketFixedPriceSale.sol#L207) to revert upon the last token being minted, meaning a user calling it afterwards would lose the ETH they sent.

### [](#proof-of-concept-6)Proof Of Concept

*   Alice creates a `customERC721` contract adhering to `INFTDropCollectionMint`. She writes `mintCountTo()` so that it returns `0` if called when all the tokens have been minted.
*   The sale happens and collectors call `mintFromFixedPriceSale` until all the tokens have been minted.
*   Bob now calls `mintFromFixedPriceSale`. Because all the tokens have been minted, the [call to mintCountTo](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-foundation/blob/792e00df429b0df9ee5d909a0a5a6e72bd07cf79/contracts/mixins/nftDropMarket/NFTDropMarketFixedPriceSale.sol#L207) does not revert but returns `0`.
*   The function call then proceeds to distribute the funds.
*   Bob have lost `mintCost` ETH, while not receiving any NFT.

You can find this [Foundry test](https://gist.github.com/joestakey/5dc8839c7622bdb9467d743924f072b6) reproducing the issue.

Note that this is not an issue of a malicious creator rugging collectors with a malicious implementation: they have implemented their contract to adhere to `INFTDropCollectionMint`, and the sale went as expected.

It is not unrealistic to imagine collectors monitoring `CreateFixedPriceSale` and calling `mintFromFixedPriceSale` based on it. In this case, all the `mintFromFixedPriceSale` processed after the last token being minted would lead to loss of funds.

> *   Here, the issue lies in the return value of `INFTDropCollectionMint.mintCountTo()` in an edge case - when all the tokens have been minted. There is no malicious implementation or wrong state logic: users calling `NFTDropMarketFixedPriceSale.mintFromFixedPriceSale` will receive the expected amount of NFTs. The problem is when the minting is done: the `DropMarket` expect subsequent calls to `mintCountTo()` to fail. While you can argue not reverting after the final token has been minted is breaking a semantic requirement, it still complies with the interface `INFTDropCollectionMint`. Not reverting on failure is a behavior that exists in other standards, such as some ERC20 tokens for instance, like [ZRX](https://etherscan.io/address/0xe41d2489571d322189246dafa5ebde1f4699f498#code).

**[HickupHH3 (judge) commented](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-foundation-findings/issues/279#issuecomment-1240810016):**

> The root cause for both issues is about the “potential errors in the implementation or misunderstanding of the interface requirements”. Simply put, the ambiguity regarding the specification of `mintCountTo()` allows for it to be exploited. As you pointed out, #211 is exploited by malicious implementations while this issue happens even if the implementation is seemingly compliant to the interface because of the ambiguity.

[](#2-contractsinterfacesicollectionfactorysol)\[2\] contracts/interfaces/ICollectionFactory.sol

In `ICollectionFactory` on line [6](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-foundation/blob/792e00df42/contracts/interfaces/ICollectionFactory.sol#L6), `IProxyCall` is never used and can safely be removed. Unless there is a plan to use it in the future. Maybe a comment explaining why it was imported here would be helpful.

[](#3-contractsmixinssharedcontractfactorysol)\[3\] contracts/mixins/shared/ContractFactory.sol
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

On line [31](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-foundation/blob/792e00df42/contracts/mixins/shared/ContractFactory.sol#L31), there is a check for `_contractFactory` to see if it already has a code. I guess this is an extra check that can be removed. Since if `_contractFactory` calls the constructor here in its own constructor by then `_contractFactory.isContract() = _contractFactory.code.length == 0`. Also, it is possible that a wrong contract address is passed here, so the check would not really do anything. This will only check against accidental EOA addresses used for `_contractFactory`. So we could possibly remove the following lines:

     5	import "@openzeppelin/contracts-upgradeable/utils/AddressUpgradeable.sol";
    13 	using AddressUpgradeable for address;
    31	require(_contractFactory.isContract(), "ContractFactory: Factory is not a contract");

If there is a stricter condition for the allowed `contractFactory` addresses, maybe we could use that instead. One possible idea is an array of implementation contract code hashes that we could check. Or maybe contracts that have a function similar to `supportsInterface` that returns a magic number which we could check here.

### [](#41-shorter-inheritance-list)4.1 Shorter inheritance list

The inheritance contracts on line [29-40](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-foundation/blob/792e00df42/contracts/NFTCollection.sol#L29-L40) can be consolidated into a shorter list:

    contract NFTCollection is
      INFTCollectionInitializer,
      ContractFactory,
      SequentialMintCollection,
      CollectionRoyalties
    {

Then you would need to adjust the overrides on lines [255](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-foundation/blob/792e00df42/contracts/NFTCollection.sol#L255) and [316](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-foundation/blob/792e00df42/contracts/NFTCollection.sol#L316)

### [](#42-cid-need-to-be-unique-per-tokenid)4.2 `CID` need to be unique per `tokenID`

Different `tokenID`s can not share the same `CID` by design. Although it is possible to design the contract so that some tokens share the same `CID` to save storage and also server space for off-chain contents.

### [](#51-iscontract)5.1 `.isContract()`

On lines [182](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-foundation/blob/792e00df42/contracts/NFTCollectionFactory.sol#L182), and [203](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-foundation/blob/792e00df42/contracts/NFTCollectionFactory.sol#L203) instead of checking if `addr.isContract()` to avoid setting the addresses to EOA by mistake it would be best to pass the code hash instead and check the code hash at those addresses. So for example:

Before:

    constructor(address _rolesContract) {
    	require(_rolesContract.isContract(), "NFTCollectionFactory: RolesContract is not a contract"); 
    
    	rolesContract = IRoles(_rolesContract);
    }

After:

    constructor(address _rolesContract, bytes32 codehash) {
    	require(_rolesContract.codehash == codehash, "NFTCollectionFactory: RolesContract is not a contract");
    
    	rolesContract = IRoles(_rolesContract);
    }

This is a stronger requirement since it would guarantee that the addresses are contracts and also they have the required code hash. For the functions to pass the `require` statements you would need to make 2 mistakes, one for the address and the other for the code hash. The probability of making this mistake should be theoretically lower than just passing a wrong address.

### [](#52-versionnftdropcollection)5.2 `versionNFTDropCollection`

Doesn’t have an initializer like `versionNFTCollection`.

### [](#53-a-better-name--can-be-chosen-for-rolescontract)5.3 a better name can be chosen for `rolesContract`

`rolerManager` might be a better name for this immutable variable and would make it easier to remember what it does (ref. line [104](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-foundation/blob/792e00df42/contracts/NFTCollectionFactory.sol#L104)).

### [](#61-supportsinterface-function)6.1 `supportsInterface` function

We can rewrite `supportsInterface` function (Lines [284-294](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-foundation/blob/792e00df42/contracts/NFTDropCollection.sol#L284-L294)) like the following block which would make it easier to read and possibly would save some gas.

    function supportsInterface(bytes4 interfaceId)
    	public
    	view
    	override(ERC165Upgradeable, AccessControlUpgradeable, ERC721Upgradeable, CollectionRoyalties)
    	returns (bool)
    {

    		super.supportsInterface(interfaceId)
    	);
    }

### [](#62-the-comment-on-line-175-needs-a-bit-of-correction)6.2 The comment on line [175](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-foundation/blob/792e00df42/contracts/NFTDropCollection.sol#L175) needs a bit of correction

So the current comment says:

> If +1 overflows then +count would also overflow, **unless count==0 in which case the loop would exceed gas limits**

But `count` can not be zero if we have reached this line. Since we have already checked for a non-zero `count` on line [172](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-foundation/blob/792e00df42/contracts/NFTDropCollection.sol#L172)

So we can change the comment to

    // If +1 overflows then +count would also overflow, since count > 0.

### [](#63-shorter-inheritance-list)6.3 Shorter inheritance list

Like `NFTCollection`, the inheritence list for `NFTDropCollection` contract on lines [28-46](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-foundation/blob/792e00df42/contracts/NFTDropCollection.sol#L28-L46) can be consolidated more.

    contract NFTDropCollection is
      INFTDropCollectionInitializer,
      INFTDropCollectionMint,
      ContractFactory,
      MinterRole,
      SequentialMintCollection,
      CollectionRoyalties
    {

The `overrides` on lines [245](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-foundation/blob/792e00df42/contracts/NFTDropCollection.sol#L245) and [287](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-foundation/blob/792e00df42/contracts/NFTDropCollection.sol#L287) would also need to be modified accordingly.

[](#7-contractsmixinsnftdropmarketnftdropmarketfixedpricesalesol)\[7\] contracts/mixins/nftDropMarket/NFTDropMarketFixedPriceSale.sol
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In `mintFromFixedPriceSale` we can avoid the nested `if` blocks on lines [182-189](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-foundation/blob/792e00df42/contracts/mixins/nftDropMarket/NFTDropMarketFixedPriceSale.sol#L182-L189). This would improve readability and analyze and it would have the same effect. On the plus side, it will also save gas for a reverting call where `saleConfig.limitPerAccount` is zero by avoiding the outer `if` block in the original code.

    // Confirm that the collection has a sale in progress.
    if (saleConfig.limitPerAccount == 0) {
    	revert NFTDropMarketFixedPriceSale_Must_Have_Sale_In_Progress();
    }
    // Confirm that the buyer will not exceed the limit specified after minting.
    if (IERC721(nftContract).balanceOf(msg.sender) + count > saleConfig.limitPerAccount) {	
    	revert NFTDropMarketFixedPriceSale_Cannot_Buy_More_Than_Limit(saleConfig.limitPerAccount);
    }

[](#8-contractsfethsol-out-of-scope)\[8\] contracts/FETH.sol (Out of Scope)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

In `constructor` instead of passing `_lockupDuration` pass `_lockupInterval` to save on the exact division check.

So taking that into consideration the `constructor` would look like this:

    constructor(
    	address payable _foundationMarket,
    	address payable _foundationDropMarket,
    	uint256 _lockupInterval
    ) {
    	if (!_foundationMarket.isContract()) {
    		revert FETH_Market_Must_Be_A_Contract();
    	}
    	if (!_foundationDropMarket.isContract()) {
    		revert FETH_Market_Must_Be_A_Contract();
    	}
    	if (_lockupInterval == 0) {
    		revert FETH_Invalid_Lockup_Duration();
    	}
    
    	foundationMarket = _foundationMarket;
    	foundationDropMarket = _foundationDropMarket;
    	lockupInterval = _lockupInterval; 
    	lockupDuration = _lockupInterval * 24;
    }

Also, the `_lockupInterval` check is moved up before the assignments to save gas in case of a revert. If there will be no revert, moving up the `if` block would not introduce any gas changes, since the check will be performed eventually.

[](#9-line-width)\[9\] Line Width
---------------------------------

Keep line width to max 120 characters for better readability.

[](#10-hard-coded-gas-limits)\[10\] Hard-coded gas limits
---------------------------------------------------------

In `contracts/mixins/shared/Constants.sol` we have 3 gas limit constants:

    uint256 constant READ_ONLY_GAS_LIMIT = 40000;
    uint256 constant SEND_VALUE_GAS_LIMIT_MULTIPLE_RECIPIENTS = 210000;
    uint256 constant SEND_VALUE_GAS_LIMIT_SINGLE_RECIPIENT = 20000;

These numbers are not future-proof as some hardforks introduce changes to gas costs. These potential future changes to gas costs might break some of the functionalities of the smart contracts that use these constants. This is something to keep in mind. If some hardfork, would break a smart contract using these numbers you would need to deploy new contracts with adjusted gas limit constants. Or you can also have these gas limits be mutable by admins on-chain. For example, all 3 of these values can be stored on-chain in 1 storage slot.

[](#11-addressiscontract-check)\[11\] `address.isContract` check
----------------------------------------------------------------

Lots of the contracts in this project import `import "@openzeppelin/contracts-upgradeable/utils/AddressUpgradeable.sol"` and use `address.isContract()` to check if an address is a contract and not a EOA. I guess this is only a check if the deployer by mistake provides the wrong address. I think this should be double-checked off-chain. If an on-chain check is needed, there are other checks that can be done that are even more strict than just checking against EOA mistakes. For example, we can provide the contract as the second input to the constructor and check the address’s codehash against that. Here is a template as an example:

    constructor(address c, bytes32 h) {
    	if( c.codehash != h) {
    		revert CustomError();
    	}
    }

Not only does this check for address with code, but also pinpoints the contract hash to a specific hash. Another type of check that can be used is to check if the provided contract address supports a specific `interfaceSupport` or call an endpoint of the contract expecting it to return a specific magic number.

Here is a list of places `isContract` has been used:

[](#13-floating-solidity-pragma-version)\[13\] Floating Solidity Pragma Version
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

It’s best to use the same compiler version across all project files/team members. So having a fixed version pragma is a good practice. Most contracts use a floating pragma which would allow the patch number to be equal or higher than the specified patch number.

[](#14-avoid-nested-if-blocks)\[14\] Avoid Nested `if` Blocks
-------------------------------------------------------------

For better readability and analysis it is better to avoid nested `if` blocks. Here is an example:

    }
    
    if (spenderAllowance < amount) {
    	revert FETH_Insufficient_Allowance(spenderAllowance);
    }
    // The check above ensures allowance cannot underflow.

Other contract developers are looking to interact with our contracts and they may be on a different version than we use. The pragma selected for our contracts is the minimum required in order to correctly compile and function. This way integration is easier if they lag a few versions behind, or if they use the latest but we don’t bump our packages frequently enough, and when we do upgrade versions unless there was a breaking solidity change — it should just swap in by incrementing our npm package version.

[](#code-impressions)Code Impressions
-------------------------------------

Overall, the code is pretty optimized:

*   Using clones to deploy contracts is an excellent call
*   The `unchecked` statements are well used
*   Storage variables are tightly packed

Just one particular finding was present across the whole project:

*   The revert strings are too long. Please try to make them fit in 32 bytes (use the first letters of the contract as a prefix, as an example, like `NFTCF` instead of `NFTCollectionFactory`), or use Custom Errors consistently

Due to some inconsistencies with the `gas-stories.txt` file, I unfortunately did not attach it.

[](#g-01-check-for-bytes_symbollength--0-before-calling-nftdropcollectioninitialize-like-its-done-for-nftcollectioninitialize)\[G-01\] Check for `bytes(_symbol).length > 0` before calling `NFTDropCollection.initialize()`, like it’s done for `NFTCollection.initialize()`
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This could save a lot of gas if the revert condition is met.

For `NFTCollection`, the check is made in `NFTCollectionFactory.createNFTCollection()`.

*   [NFTCollectionFactory.sol#L262](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-foundation/blob/main/contracts/NFTCollectionFactory.sol#L262)

    File: NFTCollectionFactory.sol
    257:   function createNFTCollection( //@audit-ok OK function
    258:     string calldata name,
    259:     string calldata symbol,
    260:     uint256 nonce
    261:   ) external returns (address collection) {
    262:     require(bytes(symbol).length != 0, "NFTCollectionFactory: Symbol is required"); //@audit why is the check inconsistently done ? Here it's in this function but for drop it's in the initialize() function. Chose 1, I'd advise this one style to save gas.
    263: 
    264:     // This reverts if the NFT was previously created using this implementation version + msg.sender + nonce
    265:     collection = implementationNFTCollection.cloneDeterministic(_getSalt(msg.sender, nonce));
    266: 
    267:     INFTCollectionInitializer(collection).initialize(payable(msg.sender), name, symbol);
    268: 
    269:     emit NFTCollectionCreated(collection, msg.sender, versionNFTCollection, name, symbol, nonce);
    270:   }

However, for `NFTDropCollection`, the check is made way further, after even the contract’s creation (during the initialization):

*   [NFTDropCollection.sol#L130](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-foundation/blob/main/contracts/NFTDropCollection.sol#L130)

    File: NFTDropCollection.sol
    120:   function initialize(
    121:     address payable _creator,
    122:     string calldata _name,
    123:     string calldata _symbol,
    124:     string calldata _baseURI,
    125:     bytes32 _postRevealBaseURIHash,
    126:     uint32 _maxTokenId,
    127:     address _approvedMinter,
    128:     address payable _paymentAddress
    129:   ) external initializer onlyContractFactory validBaseURI(_baseURI) {
    130:     require(bytes(_symbol).length > 0, "NFTDropCollection: `_symbol` must be set");
    131:     require(_maxTokenId > 0, "NFTDropCollection: `_maxTokenId` must be set");

Consider moving the check in `NFTCollectionFactory._createNFTDropCollection()`:

*   [NFTCollectionFactory.sol#L396](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-foundation/blob/main/contracts/NFTCollectionFactory.sol#L396)

    File: NFTCollectionFactory.sol
    386:   function _createNFTDropCollection(
    387:     string calldata name,
    388:     string calldata symbol,
    389:     string calldata baseURI,
    390:     bytes32 postRevealBaseURIHash,
    391:     uint32 maxTokenId,
    392:     address approvedMinter,
    393:     address payable paymentAddress,
    394:     uint256 nonce
    395:   ) private returns (address collection) {
    396:     // This reverts if the NFT was previously created using this implementation version + msg.sender + nonce
    + 396:     require(bytes(symbol).length ! 0, "NFTDropCollection: `symbol` must be set");
    397:     collection = implementationNFTDropCollection.cloneDeterministic(_getSalt(msg.sender, nonce));
    398: 
    399:     INFTDropCollectionInitializer(collection).initialize(
    400:       payable(msg.sender),
    401:       name,
    402:       symbol,
    403:       baseURI,
    404:       postRevealBaseURIHash,
    405:       maxTokenId,
    406:       approvedMinter,
    407:       paymentAddress
    408:     );

This would save the deployment cost of an impossible to initialize contract (which would further need to be destroyed before being redeployed).

[](#g-02-caching-storage-values-in-memory)\[G-02\] Caching storage values in memory
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The code can be optimized by minimizing the number of SLOADs.

SLOADs are expensive (100 gas after the 1st one) compared to MLOADs/MSTOREs (3 gas each). Storage values read multiple times should instead be cached in memory the first time (costing 1 SLOAD) and then read from this cache to avoid multiple SLOADs.

    174:     unchecked {

[](#g-05-use-calldata-instead-of-memory)\[G-05\] Use `calldata` instead of `memory`
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When a function with a `memory` array is called externally, the `abi.decode()` step has to use a for-loop to copy each index of the `calldata` to the `memory` index. Each iteration of this for-loop costs at least 60 gas (i.e. `60 * <mem_array>.length`). Using `calldata` directly bypasses this loop.

If the array is passed to an `internal` function which passes the array to another internal function where the array is modified and therefore `memory` is used in the `external` call, it’s still more gas-efficient to use `calldata` when the `external` function uses modifiers, since the modifiers may prevent the internal functions from being called. Structs have the same overhead as an array of length one

Affected code (around **60 gas** to be saved):

The following require statement is redundant:

    - 63:     require(_creator != address(0), "SequentialMintCollection: Creator cannot be the zero address"); //@audit gas: this is redundant as only factory can init and always pass good result
    64: 
    65:     owner = _creator;
    66:     maxTokenId = _maxTokenId;
    67:   }

This is due to the fact that the `initialize()` methods have the `onlyContractFactory` modifier already, and that calls to `initialize` from the factory are not using `address(0)` (and hardly ever will in the future of the solution). See these initializations where the first argument is `creator`:

    contracts/NFTCollectionFactory.sol:

[](#g-09-pre-solidity-0813--0-is-less-efficient-than--0-for-unsigned-integers)\[G-09\] Pre-Solidity `0.8.13`: `> 0` is less efficient than `!= 0` for unsigned integers
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Up until Solidity `0.8.13`: `!= 0` costs less gas compared to `> 0` for unsigned integers in `require` statements with the optimizer enabled (6 gas)

Proof: While it may seem that `> 0` is cheaper than `!=`, this is only true without the optimizer enabled and outside a require statement. If you enable the optimizer AND you’re in a `require` statement, this will save gas. You can see this tweet for more proofs: [https://twitter.com/gzeon/status/1485428085885640706](https://twitter.com/gzeon/status/1485428085885640706)

As the Solidity version used here is `0.8.12`, consider changing `> 0` with `!= 0` here:

    NFTDropCollection.sol:88:    require(bytes(_baseURI).length > 0, "NFTDropCollection: `_baseURI` must be set");
    NFTDropCollection.sol:130:    require(bytes(_symbol).length > 0, "NFTDropCollection: `_symbol` must be set");
    NFTDropCollection.sol:131:    require(_maxTokenId > 0, "NFTDropCollection: `_maxTokenId` must be set");

Also, please enable the Optimizer.

[](#g-10-arraylength-should-not-be-looked-up-in-every-loop-of-a-for-loop)\[G-10\] `<array>.length` should not be looked up in every loop of a `for-loop`
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Reading array length at each iteration of the loop consumes more gas than necessary.

In the best case scenario (length read on a memory variable), caching the array length in the stack saves around **3 gas** per iteration. In the worst case scenario (external calls at each iteration), the amount of gas wasted can be massive.

Here, consider storing the array’s length in a variable before the for-loop, and use this new variable instead:

    mixins/shared/MarketFees.sol:126:      for (uint256 i = 0; i < creatorRecipients.length; ++i) {
    mixins/shared/MarketFees.sol:198:    for (uint256 i = 0; i < creatorShares.length; ++i) {
    mixins/shared/MarketFees.sol:484:          for (uint256 i = 0; i < creatorRecipients.length; ++i) {
    mixins/shared/MarketFees.sol:503:      for (uint256 i = 1; i < creatorRecipients.length; ) {

[](#g-11-i-costs-less-gas-compared-to-i-or-i--1-same-for---i-vs-i---or-i---1)\[G-11\] `++i` costs less gas compared to `i++` or `i += 1` (same for `--i` vs `i--` or `i -= 1`)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Pre-increments and pre-decrements are cheaper.

For a `uint256 i` variable, the following is true with the Optimizer enabled at 10k:

**Increment:**

*   `i += 1` is the most expensive form
*   `i++` costs 6 gas less than `i += 1`
*   `++i` costs 5 gas less than `i++` (11 gas less than `i += 1`)

**Decrement:**

*   `i -= 1` is the most expensive form
*   `i--` costs 11 gas less than `i -= 1`
*   `--i` costs 5 gas less than `i--` (16 gas less than `i -= 1`)

Note that post-increments (or post-decrements) return the old value before incrementing or decrementing, hence the name _post-increment_:

    uint i = 1;  
    uint j = 2;
    require(j == i++, "This will be false as i is incremented after the comparison");

However, pre-increments (or pre-decrements) return the new value:

    uint i = 1;  
    uint j = 2;
    require(j == ++i, "This will be true as i is incremented before the comparison");

In the pre-increment case, the compiler has to create a temporary variable (when used) for returning `1` instead of `2`.

Affected code:

    NFTCollectionFactory.sol:207:      versionNFTCollection++;
    NFTCollectionFactory.sol:231:      versionNFTDropCollection++;

Consider using pre-increments and pre-decrements where they are relevant (meaning: not where post-increments/decrements logic are relevant).

[](#g-12-incrementsdecrements-can-be-unchecked-in-for-loops)\[G-12\] Increments/decrements can be unchecked in for-loops
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In Solidity 0.8+, there’s a default overflow check on unsigned integers. It’s possible to uncheck this in for-loops and save some gas at each iteration, but at the cost of some code readability, as this uncheck cannot be made inline.

[ethereum/solidity#10695](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/10695)

Consider wrapping with an `unchecked` block here (around **25 gas saved** per instance):

    mixins/shared/MarketFees.sol:198:    for (uint256 i = 0; i < creatorShares.length; ++i) {
    mixins/shared/MarketFees.sol:484:          for (uint256 i = 0; i < creatorRecipients.length; ++i) {

The change would be:

    - for (uint256 i; i < numIterations; i++) {
    + for (uint256 i; i < numIterations;) {
     // ...  
    +   unchecked { ++i; }
    }  

The same can be applied with decrements (which should use `break` when `i == 0`).

The risk of overflow is non-existent for `uint256` here.

[](#g-13-use-custom-errors-instead-of-revert-strings-to-save-gas)\[G-13\] Use Custom Errors instead of Revert Strings to save Gas
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Custom errors are available from solidity version 0.8.4. Custom errors save [**~50 gas**](https://gist.github.com/IllIllI000/ad1bd0d29a0101b25e57c293b4b0c746) each time they’re hit by [avoiding having to allocate and store the revert string](https://blog.soliditylang.org/2021/04/21/custom-errors/#errors-in-depth). Not defining the strings also save deployment gas

Additionally, custom errors can be used inside and outside of contracts (including interfaces and libraries).

Source: [https://blog.soliditylang.org/2021/04/21/custom-errors/](https://blog.soliditylang.org/2021/04/21/custom-errors/):

> Starting from [Solidity v0.8.4](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/releases/tag/v0.8.4), there is a convenient and gas-efficient way to explain to users why an operation failed through the use of custom errors. Until now, you could already use strings to give more information about failures (e.g., `revert("Insufficient funds.");`), but they are rather expensive, especially when it comes to deploy cost, and it is difficult to use dynamic information in them.

Consider replacing **all revert strings** with custom errors in the solution, and particularly those that have multiple occurrences:

    NFTCollectionFactory.sol:203:    require(_implementation.isContract(), "NFTCollectionFactory: Implementation is not a contract");
    NFTCollectionFactory.sol:227:    require(_implementation.isContract(), "NFTCollectionFactory: Implementation is not a contract");
