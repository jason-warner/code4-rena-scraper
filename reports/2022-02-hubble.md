[](#about-c4)About C4
---------------------

Code4rena (C4) is an open organization consisting of security researchers, auditors, developers, and individuals with domain expertise in smart contracts.

A C4 audit contest is an event in which community participants, referred to as Wardens, review, audit, or analyze smart contract logic in exchange for a bounty provided by sponsoring projects.

During the audit contest outlined in this document, C4 conducted an analysis of the Hubble smart contract system written in Solidity. The audit contest took place between February 17—February 23 2022.

This contest was judged by the Float Capital team: [moose-code](https://github.com/moose-code) and [JasoonS](https://github.com/JasoonS).

Final report assembled by [liveactionllama](https://twitter.com/liveactionllama).

[](#summary)Summary
===================

The C4 analysis yielded an aggregated total of 20 unique vulnerabilities. Of these vulnerabilities, 3 received a risk rating in the category of HIGH severity and 17 received a risk rating in the category of MEDIUM severity.

Additionally, C4 analysis included 30 reports detailing issues with a risk rating of LOW severity or non-critical. There were also 21 reports recommending gas optimizations.

All of the issues presented here are linked back to their original finding.

[](#scope)Scope
===============

The code under review can be found within the [C4 Hubble contest repository](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-hubble), and is composed of 7 smart contracts written in the Solidity programming language (2,109 lines of code) as well as 3 contracts written in the Vyper programming language (1,561 lines of code).

[](#severity-criteria)Severity Criteria
=======================================

C4 assesses the severity of disclosed vulnerabilities according to a methodology based on [OWASP standards](https://owasp.org/www-community/OWASP_Risk_Rating_Methodology).

Vulnerabilities are divided into three primary risk categories: high, medium, and low/non-critical.

High-level considerations for vulnerabilities span the following key areas when conducting assessments:

*   Malicious Input Handling
*   Escalation of privileges
*   Arithmetic
*   Gas use

Further information regarding the severity criteria referenced throughout the submission review process, please refer to the documentation provided on [the C4 website](https://code4rena.com).

[https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-hubble/blob/main/contracts/legos/Governable.sol#L5](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-hubble/blob/main/contracts/legos/Governable.sol#L5)  
[https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-hubble/blob/main/contracts/legos/Governable.sol#L24](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-hubble/blob/main/contracts/legos/Governable.sol#L24)

While Governable.sol is out of scope, I figured this issue would still be fair game.

The solution uses: `"@openzeppelin/contracts": "4.2.0"`.  
This dependency has a known high severity vulnerability: [https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JS-OPENZEPPELINCONTRACTS-2320176](https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JS-OPENZEPPELINCONTRACTS-2320176)  
Which makes this contract vulnerable:

    File: Governable.sol
    05: import { Initializable } from "@openzeppelin/contracts/proxy/utils/Initializable.sol";
    ...
    24: contract Governable is VanillaGovernable, Initializable {}

This contract is inherited at multiple places:

    contracts/AMM.sol:
      11: contract AMM is IAMM, Governable {
    
    contracts/InsuranceFund.sol:
      13: contract InsuranceFund is VanillaGovernable, ERC20Upgradeable {
    
    contracts/Oracle.sol:
      11: contract Oracle is Governable {
    
    contracts/legos/HubbleBase.sol:
      15: contract HubbleBase is Governable, Pausable, ERC2771Context {
    
    contracts/ClearingHouse.sol:
      11: contract ClearingHouse is IClearingHouse, HubbleBase {
    
    contracts/MarginAccount.sol:
      25: contract MarginAccount is IMarginAccount, HubbleBase {

ìnitializer()\` is used here:

    contracts/AMM.sol:
      99:     ) external initializer {
    
    contracts/ClearingHouse.sol:
      44:     ) external initializer {
    
    contracts/MarginAccount.sol:
      124:     ) external initializer {
    
    contracts/Oracle.sol:
      20:     function initialize(address _governance) external initializer {

### [](#recommended-mitigation-steps)Recommended Mitigation Steps

Upgrade `@openzeppelin/contracts` to version 4.4.1 or higher.

processWithdrawals can process limited amount in each call.  
An attacker can push to withdrawals enormous amount of withdrawals with amount = 0.  
In order to stop the dos attack and process the withdrawal, the governance needs to spend as much gas as the attacker.  
If the governance doesn’t have enough money to pay for the gas, the withdrawals can’t be processed.

### [](#proof-of-concept)Proof of Concept

Alice wants to attack vusd, she spends 1 millions dollars for gas to push as many withdrawals of amount = 0 as she can.  
If the governance wants to process the deposits after Alices empty deposits, they also need to spend at least 1 million dollars for gas in order to process Alice’s withdrawals first.  
But the governance doesn’t have 1 million dollars so the funds will be locked.

### [](#recommended-mitigation-steps-1)Recommended Mitigation Steps

Set a minimum amount of withdrawal. e.g. 1 dollar

        function withdraw(uint amount) external {
            require(amount >= 10 ** 6);
            burn(amount);
            withdrawals.push(Withdrawal(msg.sender, amount));
        }

> Would be interested to see the exact gas cost of executing withdraw. The thing is the grievance costs only gas to execute and the withdraw function is relatively cheap from first glance. The main issue here is that it can become SUPER expensive to clear the que in gas. I.e. if the attacker builds up a que of 200 withdrawals, some unknowning sucker is going to pay for more than 200 erc20 transfers in order to get their money out. Thats more than anyone would want to pay, and further since so much gas limit would be needed for this to be executed, to fit into a block you are going to have to pay a huge price.
> 
> So basically it costs attacker x to execute, which means it is also going to cost next user likely even more than x to fix the problem.
> 
> Also the que is not cleared so processWithdrawals becomes a really expensive function. If the items were cleared and set back to zero it would make it less expensive to de-que the que.
> 
> This being said we definitely have this at at least medium severity. $10k in gas to constantly brick users withdrawls from protocol for a week is a serious issue and not the biggest cost for an attack.
> 
> @JasoonS, going to put this as medium. Let’s discuss whether we want to have it as high.

**[moose-code (judge) commented](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-hubble-findings/issues/119#issuecomment-1059983807):**

> Okay, going to keep this as high severity. The cost to fix the attack can be more than what the attack costs in total. It also burdens a random unsuspecting user with a really high gas cost to try and get their withdrawal. There are many good suggestions on how to fix this.

[https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-hubble/blob/8c157f519bc32e552f8cc832ecc75dc381faa91e/contracts/InsuranceFund.sol#L44-L54](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-hubble/blob/8c157f519bc32e552f8cc832ecc75dc381faa91e/contracts/InsuranceFund.sol#L44-L54)  

The `InsuranceFund.deposit` function mints initial `shares` equal to the deposited amount.  
The deposit / withdraw functions also use the VUSD contract balance for the shares computation. (`balance() = vusd.balanceOf(address(this))`)

It’s possible to increase the share price to very high amounts and price out smaller depositors.

### [](#proof-of-concept-1)Proof of Concept

*   `deposit(_amount = 1)`: Deposit the smallest unit of VUSD as the first depositor. Mint 1 share and set the total supply and VUSD balance to `1`.
*   Perform a direct transfer of `1000.0` VUSD to the `InsuranceFund`. The `balance()` is now `1000e6 + 1`
*   Doing any deposits of less than `1000.0` VUSD will mint zero shares: `shares = _amount * _totalSupply / _pool = 1000e6 * 1 / (1000e6 + 1) = 0`.
*   The attacker can call `withdraw(1)` to burn their single share and receive the entire pool balance, making a profit. (`balance() * _shares / totalSupply() = balance()`)

I give this a high severity as the same concept can be used to always steal the initial insurance fund deposit by frontrunning it and doing the above-mentioned steps, just sending the frontrunned deposit amount to the contract instead of the fixed `1000.0`. They can then even repeat the steps to always frontrun and steal any deposits.

### [](#recommended-mitigation-steps-2)Recommended Mitigation Steps

The way [UniswapV2 prevents this](https://github.com/Uniswap/v2-core/blob/4dd59067c76dea4a0e8e4bfdda41877a6b16dedc/contracts/UniswapV2Pair.sol#L121) is by requiring a minimum deposit amount and sending `1000` initial shares to the zero address to make this attack more expensive. The same mitigation can be done here.

If the price feed is manipulated in any way or there is any malfunction based volatility on the market, a malicious user can use this to liquidate a healthy position.

An attacker can setup a monitoring of the used Oracle feed and act on observing a price outbreak (for example, zero price, which is usually a subject to filtration), liquidating the trader position which is perfectly healthy otherwise, obtaining the collateral with a substantial discount at the expense of the trader.

The same is for a flash crash kind of scenario, i.e. a price outbreak of any nature will allow for non-market liquidation by an attacker, who has the incentives to setup such a monitoring and act on such an outbreak, knowing that it will not be smoothed or filtered out, allowing a liquidation at a non-market price that happen to be printed in the Oracle feed

### [](#proof-of-concept-2)Proof of Concept

Oracle.getUnderlyingPrice just passes on the latest Oracle answer, not checking it anyhow:

[https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-hubble/blob/main/contracts/Oracle.sol#L24-L35](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-hubble/blob/main/contracts/Oracle.sol#L24-L35)

It is then used in liquidation triggers providing isLiquidatable and \_getLiquidationInfo functions:

[https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-hubble/blob/main/contracts/MarginAccount.sol#L249](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-hubble/blob/main/contracts/MarginAccount.sol#L249)

[https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-hubble/blob/main/contracts/MarginAccount.sol#L465](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-hubble/blob/main/contracts/MarginAccount.sol#L465)

### [](#recommended-mitigation-steps-3)Recommended Mitigation Steps

Add a non-zero Oracle price check, possibly add an additional Oracle feed information usage to control that the price is fresh. Please consult the Chainlink for that as OCR introduction might have changed the state of the art approach (i.e. whether and how to use latestRoundData returned data):

[https://docs.chain.link/docs/off-chain-reporting/](https://docs.chain.link/docs/off-chain-reporting/)

Regarding any price spikes it is straightforward to construct a mitigation mechanics for such cases, so the system will be affected by sustainable price movements only.

As price outrages provide a substantial attack surface for the project it’s worth adding some complexity to the implementation.

One of the approaches is to track both current and TWAP prices, and condition all state changing actions, including liquidations, on the current price being within a threshold of the TWAP one. If the liquidation margin level is conservative enough and TWAP window is small enough this is safe for the overall stability of the system, while providing substantial mitigation mechanics by allowing state changes on the locally calm market only.

Another approach is to introduce time delay between liquidation request and actual liquidation. Again, conservative enough margin level plus small enough delay keeps the system safe, while requiring that market conditions allow for liquidation both at request time and at execution time provides ample filtration against price feed outbreaks

_Submitted by 0x1f8b_

The contract use two governance model, one looks hidden.

### [](#proof-of-concept-3)Proof of Concept

The [VUSD contract](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-hubble/blob/8c157f519bc32e552f8cc832ecc75dc381faa91e/contracts/VUSD.sol#L11) uses `VanillaGovernable` but inherits from `ERC20PresetMinterPauserUpgradeable` and this contract uses roles to use some administrative methods like `pause` or `mint`.

This two-governance model does not seem necessary and can hide or raise suspicion about a rogue pool, thus damaging the user’s trust.

### [](#recommended-mitigation-steps-4)Recommended Mitigation Steps

Unify governance in only one, VanillaGovernable or role based.

**[atvanguard (Hubble) confirmed and resolved](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-hubble-findings/issues/11)**

**[moose-code (judge) commented](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-hubble-findings/issues/11#issuecomment-1059926864):**

> Yes, a good suggestion to keep governance more tightly coupled. OZ has AccessControlledAndUpgradeable which is really nice. Various roles for varying level of admin functionality. Allows tighter controls on more controversial items and easier control on less controversial items.

[https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-hubble/blob/main/contracts/ClearingHouse.sol#L269-L282](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-hubble/blob/main/contracts/ClearingHouse.sol#L269-L282)

`ClearingHouse.sol` allows the Governance protocol to whitelist `AMM.sol` contracts. These contracts allow users to earn profits based on the price of a base asset against a quote asset.

It is possible to add the same `AMM` twice in the function `whitelistAmm()`. The impact is that unrealized profits will be counted multiple times. As a result the liquidation calculations will be incorrect, potentially allowing users to trade while insolvent or incorrectly liquidating solvent users.

Note `whitelistAmm()` may only be called by Governance.

### [](#proof-of-concept-4)Proof of Concept

The function `getTotalNotionalPositionAndUnrealizedPnl()` will iterate over all `amms` summing the `unrealizedPnl` and `notinoalPosition`, thus if an `amm` is repeated the `unrealizedPnl` and `notionalPosition` of that asset will be counted multiple times.

This is used in `_calcMarginFraction()` which calculates a users margin as a fraction of the total position. The margin fraction is used to determine if a user is liquitable or is allowed to open new positions.

### [](#recommended-mitigation-steps-5)Recommended Mitigation Steps

Consider ensuring the `AMM` does not already exist in the list when adding a new `AMM`.

        function whitelistAmm(address _amm) external onlyGovernance {
            for (uint256 i; i < amm.length; i++) {
                require(amm[i] != IAMM(_amm), "AMM already whitelisted");
            }
            emit MarketAdded(amms.length, _amm);
            amms.push(IAMM(_amm));
        }

As the number of supported markets grow, `settleFunding` will reach a point were it exceeds the block gas limit on Avalanche C-Chain. This will prevent users from calling the function and cause a wide spread Denial of Service.

Looking at transactions for the current testnet deployment, `settleFunding` already reaches almost 10% of the block gas limit. This is due settle funding iteratively looping through each market, with each iteration entering an unbounded `while` loop in `_calcTwap`. The more active the markets are, the more gas intensive `_calcTwap` becomes, as more snapshots need to be traversed.

The combination of more active markets and an increase in available markets make it very likely that some users will be unable to call `settleFunding` in the long run.

### [](#recommended-mitigation-steps-6)Recommended Mitigation Steps

Users should be allowed to settle funding per market or using an array of markets opposed to all markets at once.

    function settleFundingForMarkets(IAMM[] markets) override external whenNotPaused {
         for (uint i = 0; i < markets.length; i++) {
              markets[i].settleFunding();
         }
    }

In this way the gas cost will not increase with the number of markets created over time.

The `Oracle.getUnderlyingPrice` function divides the chainlink price by `100`.  
It probably assumes that the answer for the underlying is in 8 decimals but then wants to reduce it for 6 decimals to match USDC.

However, arbitrary `underlying` tokens are used and the chainlink oracles can have different decimals.

### [](#recommended-mitigation-steps-7)Recommended Mitigation Steps

While most USD price feeds use 8 decimals, it’s better to take the on-chain reported decimals into account by doing `AggregatorV3Interface(chainLinkAggregatorMap[underlying]).decimals()`, see [Chainlink docs](https://docs.chain.link/docs/get-the-latest-price/#getting-a-different-price-denomination).  
The price should then be scaled down to 6 decimals.

A user can get a much larger portion of the pool as it recovers from a debt seizure. The intent of the insurance pool seems to be that it could recover from a bad debt event.

### [](#proof-of-concept-6)Proof of Concept

1.  Alice is the first LP to the insurance pool, and deposits 1e18 shares.
2.  `seizeBadDebt` is called with 2e18. Now, there are `pendingObligations = 1e18`, and there is 0 vusd in the insurance fund.
3.  Bob (the attacker) directly transfers 1e18 + 1 vUSD.
4.  Bob calls deposit with 1e18 vUSD. All pending obligations will be settled, but there will only be 1 vUSD left in the pool before Bob’s deposit. Bob receives `shares = 1e18 * 1e18 / 1`. As a result, Bob will get `1e36` shares, diluting Alice’s share of the pool. Bob will be able to take a much larger share of all future profits from the insurance fund until more bad debt is seized. Bob only provided 2e18 + 1 liqudiity, but received an exponentially larger number of shares than Alice.

### [](#recommended-mitigation-steps-8)Recommended Mitigation Steps

It depends on how you want this to work. You could keep track of the total amount ever contributed by users, and use that for calculations. Or just make staking 1 vUSD = 1 share if the pool total is below the total number of shares.

[https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-hubble/blob/main/contracts/ClearingHouse.sol#L332](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-hubble/blob/main/contracts/ClearingHouse.sol#L332)  

It is assumed that VAMM returned positions have exactly `6` decimals for all AMMs white listed in ClearingHouse.

In the same time an array of different AMMs/VAMMs is supported, and there are no guarantees/checks of the precision of the position values they return.

If an VAMM that have different precision is whitelisted, for example having 18 decimals for position figures, then margin requirements checks become invalid.

This will lead to various malfunctions, say perfectly valid positions will be liquidated by any attacker noticing that the calculations are skewed.

### [](#proof-of-concept-7)Proof of Concept

ClearingHouse’s \_calcMarginFraction is the function that is used for margin requirements checks:

[https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-hubble/blob/main/contracts/ClearingHouse.sol#L163-L167](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-hubble/blob/main/contracts/ClearingHouse.sol#L163-L167)

[https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-hubble/blob/main/contracts/ClearingHouse.sol#L188-L189](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-hubble/blob/main/contracts/ClearingHouse.sol#L188-L189)

\_calcMarginFraction calls getNotionalPositionAndMargin:

[https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-hubble/blob/main/contracts/ClearingHouse.sol#L319-L320](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-hubble/blob/main/contracts/ClearingHouse.sol#L319-L320)

getNotionalPositionAndMargin calls getTotalNotionalPositionAndUnrealizedPnl:

[https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-hubble/blob/main/contracts/ClearingHouse.sol#L291](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-hubble/blob/main/contracts/ClearingHouse.sol#L291)

getTotalNotionalPositionAndUnrealizedPnl sums up AMM’s getNotionalPositionAndUnrealizedPnl results:

[https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-hubble/blob/main/contracts/ClearingHouse.sol#L269-L282](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-hubble/blob/main/contracts/ClearingHouse.sol#L269-L282)

AMM’s getNotionalPositionAndUnrealizedPnl returns vamm.get\_notional result:

[https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-hubble/blob/main/contracts/AMM.sol#L395-L410](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-hubble/blob/main/contracts/AMM.sol#L395-L410)

The above calls are linear decimals wise (i.e. do subtractions/additions kind of operations, preserving the decimals).

Then, \_getMarginFraction mixes up these notionalPosition and margin, obtained from AMM without rescaling, as if they are PRECISION scaled:

[https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-hubble/blob/main/contracts/ClearingHouse.sol#L332](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-hubble/blob/main/contracts/ClearingHouse.sol#L332)

PRECISION is hard coded to be `1e6`:

[https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-hubble/blob/main/contracts/ClearingHouse.sol#L15](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-hubble/blob/main/contracts/ClearingHouse.sol#L15)

For other VAMM operations base precision is set to `1e18`:

[https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-hubble/blob/main/contracts/AMM.sol#L17](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-hubble/blob/main/contracts/AMM.sol#L17)

For example, VAMM returned supply is assumed to have 18 decimals:

[https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-hubble/blob/main/contracts/AMM.sol#L523](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-hubble/blob/main/contracts/AMM.sol#L523)

Comment says that exchangeExactOut returned quantity will have 6 decimals precision:

[https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-hubble/blob/main/contracts/AMM.sol#L495](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-hubble/blob/main/contracts/AMM.sol#L495)

As the system imply that VAMMs can vary it is neither guaranteed, nor checked in any way (briefly checked dydx api code, it looks like there are no explicit guarantees either).

If any of VAMM referenced via white listed AMMs return VAMM.get_notional with decimals different from `6`, the \\_calcMarginFraction result will become grossly incorrect.

### [](#recommended-mitigation-steps-9)Recommended Mitigation Steps

If AMM contract is desired to deal with various VAMMs, consider removing decimals related hard coding, adding decimals variables and scaling VAMM returned results accordingly, so that position and margin values’ decimals of 6, implied by ClearingHouse logic, be ensured.

VUSD withdraw queue will be blocked and user funds frozen simply by requesting a zero value withdraw, if the reserve token doesn’t support zero value transfers.

Putting it medium only on an assumption that reserve will be USDC and the probability is low, but VUSD do allow any reserve token and the impact here is both funds freeze and stopping of the operations

### [](#proof-of-concept-10)Proof of Concept

It is possible to burn zero amount in OZ implementation:

[https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts-upgradeable/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20Upgradeable.sol#L285-L300](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts-upgradeable/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20Upgradeable.sol#L285-L300)

So, withdraw will burn zero amount and put it to the queue:

[https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-hubble/blob/main/contracts/VUSD.sol#L48](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-hubble/blob/main/contracts/VUSD.sol#L48)

USDC does support zero value transfers, but not all the tokens do:

[https://github.com/d-xo/weird-erc20#revert-on-zero-value-transfers](https://github.com/d-xo/weird-erc20#revert-on-zero-value-transfers)

Currently VUSD can use any reserve token:

[https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-hubble/blob/main/contracts/VUSD.sol#L33](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-hubble/blob/main/contracts/VUSD.sol#L33)

Withdraw queue position can be modified in the `processWithdrawals` function only.

But it will fail every time on the zero amount entry, as there is no way to skip it (and mint VUSD back, for example), so anything else after this zero entry will not be processed:

[https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-hubble/blob/main/contracts/VUSD.sol#L62](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-hubble/blob/main/contracts/VUSD.sol#L62)

This way the withdrawal functionality and the corresponding user funds will be frozen within VUSD contract, which will become inoperable

### [](#recommended-mitigation-steps-11)Recommended Mitigation Steps

Consider adding a zero amount check, as it doesn’t cost much, while zero transfer doesn’t make sense anyway.

Now:

    reserveToken.safeTransfer(withdrawal.usr, withdrawal.amount);
    reserve -= withdrawal.amount;

To be:

    if (withdrawal.amount > 0) {
    	reserveToken.safeTransfer(withdrawal.usr, withdrawal.amount);
    	reserve -= withdrawal.amount;
    }

A user is able to front-run the call to `seizeBadDebt()` in `InsuranceFund.sol` to avoid paying the insurance costs.

`seizeBadDebt()` is called by `MarginAccount.settleBadDebt()` which is a public function. When this functions is called the transaction will appear in the mem pool. A user may then call `InsuranceFund.withdraw()` to withdraw all of their shares. If they do this with a higher gas fee it will likely be processed before the `settleBadDebt()` transaction. In this way they will avoid incurring any cost from the assets being seized.

The impact is that users may gain their share of the insurance funding payments with minimal risk (minimal as there is a change the front-run will not succeed) of having to repay these costs.

### [](#proof-of-concept-11)Proof of Concept

        function withdraw(uint _shares) external {
            settlePendingObligation();
            require(pendingObligation == 0, "IF.withdraw.pending_obligations");
            uint amount = balance() * _shares / totalSupply();
            _burn(msg.sender, _shares);
            vusd.safeTransfer(msg.sender, amount);
            emit FundsWithdrawn(msg.sender, amount, block.timestamp);
        }

        function seizeBadDebt(uint amount) external onlyMarginAccount {
            pendingObligation += amount;
            emit BadDebtAccumulated(amount, block.timestamp);
            settlePendingObligation();
        }

### [](#recommended-mitigation-steps-12)Recommended Mitigation Steps

Consider making the withdrawals a two step process. The first step requests a withdrawal and marks the time. The second request processes the withdrawal but requires a period of time to elapse since the first step.

To avoid having users constantly having pending withdrawal, each withdrawal should have an expiry time and also a recharge time. The if the second step is not called within expiry amount of time it should be considered invalid. The first step must not be able to be called until recharge time has passed.

Another solution involves a design change where the insurance fund is slowly filled up over time without external deposits. However, this has the disadvantage that bad debts received early in the protocols life time may not have sufficient insurance capital to cover them.

The contact `AMM.sol` cannot be initialize unless it is called from the `_governance` address.

This prevents the use of a deployer account and requires the governance to be able to deploy proxy contracts and encode the required arguements. If this is not feasible then the contract cannot be deployed.

### [](#proof-of-concept-12)Proof of Concept

`initialize()` calls `_setGovernace(_governance);` which will store the governance address.

Following this it will call `syncDeps(_registry);` which has `onlyGovernance` modifier. Thus, if the `msg.sender` of `initialize()` is not the same as the parameter `_governance` then the initialisation will revert.

        function initialize(
            address _registry,
            address _underlyingAsset,
            string memory _name,

            address _governance

            _setGovernace(_governance);
    
            vamm = IVAMM(_vamm);
            underlyingAsset = _underlyingAsset;
            name = _name;
            fundingBufferPeriod = 15 minutes;
    
            syncDeps(_registry);
        }

### [](#recommended-mitigation-steps-13)Recommended Mitigation Steps

Consider adding the steps manually to `initialize()`. i.e.

        function initialize(
            address _registry,
            address _underlyingAsset,
            string memory _name,

The insurance fund doesn’t have a way to transfer non-vusd out of the contract.

Assets transferred to the InsuranceFund will be locked forever.

### [](#recommended-mitigation-steps-14)Recommended Mitigation Steps

Have a way for governance to sweep tokens to swap them.

When an account is liquidated, there is no minimum amount of the swap, which makes it vulnerable for sandwich attacks.

### [](#proof-of-concept-14)Proof of Concept

Alice’s long position can be liquidated, bob notices it and creates a short position,  
then liquidates her position, thus swapping the base asset to the quote asset,  
therefore reducing the base asset price,  
then he redeems his short position and profits because the price went down.

### [](#recommended-mitigation-steps-15)Recommended Mitigation Steps

Set quoteAssetLimit in `_reducePosition` to prevent the attack.

    function syncDeps(IRegistry _registry) public onlyGovernance {
        vusd = IERC20(_registry.vusd());
        marginAccount = _registry.marginAccount();
    }

The `Governance` address can call `InsuranceFund.sol#syncDeps()` to change the contract address of `vusd` anytime.

However, since the tx to set a new address for `vusd` can get in between users’ txs to deposit and withdraw, in some edge cases, it can result in users’ loss of funds.

### [](#proof-of-concept-15)Proof of Concept

1.  Alice deposited `1,000,000 VUSD` to `InsuranceFund`;
2.  Gov called `syncDeps()` and set `vusd` to the address of `VUSDv2`;
3.  Alice called `withdraw()` with all the `shares` and get back `0 VUSDv2`.

As a result, Alice suffered a fund loss of `1,000,000 VUSD`.

##### [](#recommended-mitigation-steps-16)Recommended Mitigation Steps

1.  Consider making `vusd` unchangeable;
2.  If a possible migration of `vusd` must be considered, consider changing the `syncDeps()` to:

    function syncDeps(IRegistry _registry) public onlyGovernance {
        uint _balance = balance();
        vusd = IERC20(_registry.vusd());
        require(balance() >= _balance);

### [](#proof-of-concept-16)Proof of Concept

Currently, withdrawals are queued in an array and processed sequentially in a for loop.  
However, a `safeTransfer()` to USDC blacklisted user will fail. It will also brick the withdrawal system because the blacklisted user is never cleared.

The current implementaion is using a non-upgradeable version of the Ownable library. Instead of the upgradeable version: @openzeppelin/contracts-upgradeable/access/OwnableUpgradeable.sol.

A regular, non-upgradeable Ownable library will make the deployer the default owner in the constructor. Due to a requirement of the proxy-based upgradeability system, no constructors can be used in upgradeable contracts. Therefore, there will be no owner when the contract is deployed as a proxy contract

### [](#recommended-mitigation-steps-18)Recommended Mitigation Steps

Use @openzeppelin/contracts-upgradeable/access/OwnableUpgradeable.sol and @openzeppelin/contracts-upgradeable/proxy/utils/Initializable.sol instead.

And add \__Ownable_init(); at the beginning of the initializer.

[](#l-02-single-step-change-of-governance-address-is-extremely-risky)\[L-02\] Single-step change of governance address is extremely risky
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Single-step change of critical governance address and lack of zero address check is extremely risky. If a zero address or incorrect address (private key not available) is used accidentally, or maliciously changed by a compromised governance account then the entire governance of the protocol is locked forever or lost to an attacker. No governance changes can be made by authorized governance account and protocol will have to be redeployed. The reputation of the protocol will take a huge hit. There may be significant fund lock/loss as well.

Interestingly, this 2-step process is applied to the changing of Strategist address but not Governance address. Governance has more authority in the protocol because it can change the Strategist among other things. So this 2-step should definitely be applied to Governance as well.

Given the magnitude of the impact, i.e. permanent lock of all governance actions, potential lock/loss of funds, and the known/documented failures of wallet opsec, this risk is classified as medium severity.

*   Ensure that to check previous balance/after balance equals to amount for any rebasing/inflation/deflation
*   Add support in contracts for such tokens before accepting user-supplied tokens
*   Consider supporting deflationary / rebasing / etc tokens by extra checking the balances before/after or strictly inform your users not to use such tokens if they don’t want to lose them.

[](#l-06-missing-events-for-governor-only-functions-that-change-critical-parameters)\[L-06\] Missing events for governor only functions that change critical parameters
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The governor only functions that change critical parameters should emit events. Events allow capturing the changed parameters so that off-chain tools/interfaces can register such changes with timelocks that allow users to evaluate them and consider if they would like to engage/exit based on how they perceive the changes as affecting the trustworthiness of the protocol or profitability of the implemented financial services. The alternative of directly querying on-chain contract state for such changes is not considered practical for most users/usages.

Missing events and timelocks do not promote transparency and if such changes immediately affect users’ perception of fairness or trustworthiness, they could exit the protocol causing a reduction in liquidity which could negatively impact protocol TVL and reputation.

There are owner functions that do not emit any events in the contracts.

[](#l-07-deprecated-safeapprove-function)\[L-07\] Deprecated safeApprove() function

Detailed description of the impact of this finding.

Using this deprecated function can lead to unintended reverts and potentially the locking of funds. A deeper discussion on the deprecation of this function is in [OZ issue #2219](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/issues/2219). The OpenZeppelin ERC20 `safeApprove()` function has been deprecated, as seen in the comments of the OpenZeppelin code.

There is no pause mechanism has been defined.

### [](#recommended-mitigation-steps-27)Recommended Mitigation Steps

Pause functionality on the contract would have helped secure the funds quickly.

[](#n-01-use-of-blocktimestamp)\[N-01\] Use of Block.timestamp
--------------------------------------------------------------

Block timestamps have historically been used for a variety of applications, such as entropy for random numbers (see the Entropy Illusion for further details), locking funds for periods of time, and various state-changing conditional statements that are time-dependent. Miners have the ability to adjust timestamps slightly, which can prove to be dangerous if block timestamps are used incorrectly in smart contracts.

### [](#proof-of-concept-26)Proof of Concept

Navigate to the following contract:

[https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-hubble/blob/8c157f519bc32e552f8cc832ecc75dc381faa91e/contracts/legos/HubbleBase.sol#L49](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-hubble/blob/8c157f519bc32e552f8cc832ecc75dc381faa91e/contracts/legos/HubbleBase.sol#L49)

### [](#recommended-mitigation-steps-28)Recommended Mitigation Steps

Block timestamps should not be used for entropy or generating random numbers—i.e., they should not be the deciding factor (either directly or through some derivation) for winning a game or changing an important state.

Time-sensitive logic is sometimes required; e.g., for unlocking contracts (time-locking), completing an ICO after a few weeks, or enforcing expiry dates. It is sometimes recommended to use block.number and an average block time to estimate times; with a 10 second block time, 1 week equates to approximately, 60480 blocks. Thus, specifying a block number at which to change a contract state can be more secure, as miners are unable to easily manipulate the block number.

[](#n-02-missing-re-entrancy-guard)\[N-02\] Missing Re-entrancy Guard
---------------------------------------------------------------------

The re-entrancy guard is missing on the Eth anchor interaction. The external router interaction can cause to the re-entrancy vulnerability.

[](#foreword)Foreword
---------------------

*   **Storage-reading optimizations**

> The code can be optimized by minimising the number of SLOADs. SLOADs are expensive (100 gas) compared to MLOADs/MSTOREs (3 gas). In the paragraphs below, please see the `@audit-issue` tags in the pieces of code’s comments for more information about SLOADs that could be saved by caching the mentioned **storage** variables in **memory** variables.

*   **Unchecking arithmetics operations that can’t underflow/overflow**

> Solidity version 0.8+ comes with implicit overflow and underflow checks on unsigned integers. When an overflow or an underflow isn’t possible (as an example, when a comparison is made before the arithmetic operation, or the operation doesn’t depend on user input), some gas can be saved by using an `unchecked` block: [https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.10/control-structures.html#checked-or-unchecked-arithmetic](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.10/control-structures.html#checked-or-unchecked-arithmetic)

*   **`@audit` tags**

> The code is annotated at multiple places with `//@audit` comments to pinpoint the issues. Please, pay attention to them for more details.

[](#summary-1)Summary
---------------------

*   One pattern that was often seen is caching structs in memory when it’s not needed. A copy in memory of a storage struct will trigger as many SLOADs as there are slots. If the struct’s fields are only read once, or if the number of storage reading would be inferior to the number of slots: don’t cache the struct in memory.

    129:         }
    130:         _emitPositionChanged(trader, realizedPnl);
    131:     }

#### [](#do-not-cache-positionstrader-in-memory)Do not cache `positions[trader]` in memory

As a copy in memory of a struct makes as many SLOADs as there are slots, here a copy costs 3 SLOADs:

    41:     struct Position {
    42:         int256 size;
    43:         uint256 openNotional;
    44:         int256 lastPremiumFraction;
    45:     }

However, only the `size` field is read twice. Therefore, only this field should get cached: `int256 _size = positions[trader].size;`

### [](#function-liquidateposition)function liquidatePosition()

    133:     function liquidatePosition(address trader)
    134:         override
    135:         external
    136:         onlyClearingHouse
    137:         returns (int realizedPnl, uint quoteAsset)
    138:     {
    139:         // don't need an ammState check because there should be no active positions
    140:         Position memory position = positions[trader]; //@audit 3 SLOADs vs 1 enough
    141:         bool isLongPosition = position.size > 0 ? true : false;
    142:         // sending market orders can fk the trader. @todo put some safe guards around price of liquidations
    143:         if (isLongPosition) {
    144:             (realizedPnl, quoteAsset) = _reducePosition(trader, -position.size, 0);
    145:         } else {
    146:             (realizedPnl, quoteAsset) = _reducePosition(trader, -position.size, type(uint).max);
    147:         }
    148:         _emitPositionChanged(trader, realizedPnl);
    149:     }

#### [](#do-not-cache-positionstrader-in-memory-1)Do not cache `positions[trader]` in memory

Similar to [Do not cache `positions[trader]` in memory](#do-not-cache-positionstrader-in-memory).

However, only the `size` field is read 3 times. Therefore, only this field should get cached: `int256 _size = positions[trader].size;`

### [](#function-removeliquidity)function removeLiquidity()

    133:     function liquidatePosition(address trader)
    134:         override
    135:         external
    136:         onlyClearingHouse
    137:         returns (int realizedPnl, uint quoteAsset)
    138:     {
    139:         // don't need an ammState check because there should be no active positions
    140:         Position memory position = positions[trader]; //@audit 3 SLOADs vs 1 enough
    141:         bool isLongPosition = position.size > 0 ? true : false;
    142:         // sending market orders can fk the trader. @todo put some safe guards around price of liquidations
    143:         if (isLongPosition) {
    144:             (realizedPnl, quoteAsset) = _reducePosition(trader, -position.size, 0);
    145:         } else {
    146:             (realizedPnl, quoteAsset) = _reducePosition(trader, -position.size, type(uint).max);
    147:         }
    148:         _emitPositionChanged(trader, realizedPnl);
    149:     }

#### [](#do-not-cache-positionsmaker-in-memory)Do not cache `positions[maker]` in memory

Similar to [Do not cache `positions[trader]` in memory](#do-not-cache-positionstrader-in-memory). However, here, even the fields shouldn’t get cached, as they are read only once:

    220:         Position memory _taker = positions[maker];//@audit 3 SLOADs vs 2 enough
    ...
    233:             _taker.size,
    234:             _taker.openNotional

Therefore, use `220: Position storage _taker = positions[maker];`

#### [](#do-not-cache-makersmaker-in-memory)Do not cache `makers[maker]` in memory

Similarly, a copy in memory for `Maker` costs 7 SLOADs:

    48:     struct Maker {
    49:         uint vUSD;
    50:         uint vAsset;
    51:         uint dToken;
    52:         int pos; // position
    53:         int posAccumulator; // value of global.posAccumulator until which pos has been updated
    54:         int lastPremiumFraction;
    55:         int lastPremiumPerDtoken;
    56:     }

Here, caching the first 5 fields in memory is enough.

    406:             _maker.vUSD,
    407:             _maker.vAsset,
    408:             _taker.size,

    95:         IERC20 token; //@audit 20 bytes
    96:         uint weight; //@audit 32 bytes
    97:         uint8 decimals; //@audit 1 byte
    98:     }

to

    94:     struct Collateral {
    95:         IERC20 token; //@audit 20 bytes
    96:         uint8 decimals; //@audit 1 byte
    97:         uint weight; //@audit 32 bytes
    98:     }

### [](#variables)Variables

#### [](#no-need-to-explicitly-initialize-variables-with-default-values)No need to explicitly initialize variables with default values

If a variable is not set/initialized, it is assumed to have the default value (`0` for `uint`, `false` for `bool`, `address(0)` for address…). Explicitly initializing it with its default value is an anti-pattern and wastes gas.

As an example: `for (uint256 i = 0; i < numIterations; ++i) {` should be replaced with `for (uint256 i; i < numIterations; ++i) {`

Instances include:

    ClearingHouse.sol:122:        for (uint i = 0; i < amms.length; i++) {
    ClearingHouse.sol:130:        for (uint i = 0; i < amms.length; i++) {
    ClearingHouse.sol:170:        for (uint i = 0; i < amms.length; i++) {
    ClearingHouse.sol:194:        for (uint i = 0; i < amms.length; i++) { // liquidate all positions
    ClearingHouse.sol:251:        for (uint i = 0; i < amms.length; i++) {
    ClearingHouse.sol:263:        for (uint i = 0; i < amms.length; i++) {
    ClearingHouse.sol:277:        for (uint i = 0; i < amms.length; i++) {
    InsuranceFund.sol:52:        uint shares = 0;
    MarginAccount.sol:31:    uint constant VUSD_IDX = 0;
    MarginAccount.sol:331:        for (uint i = 0; i < idxs.length; i++) {
    MarginAccount.sol:521:        for (uint i = 0; i < assets.length; i++) {
    MarginAccount.sol:552:        for (uint i = 0; i < _collaterals.length; i++) {
    MarginAccountHelper.sol:13:    uint constant VUSD_IDX = 0;

I suggest removing explicit initializations for default values.

### [](#comparisons)Comparisons

#### [](#-0-is-less-efficient-than--0-for-unsigned-integers-with-proof)`> 0` is less efficient than `!= 0` for unsigned integers (with proof)

`!= 0` costs less gas compared to `> 0` for unsigned integers in `require` statements with the optimizer enabled (6 gas)

Proof: While it may seem that `> 0` is cheaper than `!=`, this is only true without the optimizer enabled and outside a require statement. If you enable the optimizer at 10k AND you’re in a `require` statement, this will save gas. You can see this tweet for more proofs: [https://twitter.com/gzeon/status/1485428085885640706](https://twitter.com/gzeon/status/1485428085885640706)

`> 0` in require statements are used in the following location(s):

    AMM.sol:487:        require(baseAssetQuantity > 0, "VAMM._long: baseAssetQuantity is <= 0");
    AMM.sol:511:        require(baseAssetQuantity < 0, "VAMM._short: baseAssetQuantity is >= 0");
    ClearingHouse.sol:51:        require(_maintenanceMargin > 0, "_maintenanceMargin < 0");
    MarginAccount.sol:150:        require(amount > 0, "Add non-zero margin");
    Oracle.sol:153:        require(_round > 0, "Not enough history");

I suggest you change `> 0` with `!= 0` in require statements. Also, enable the Optimizer.

### [](#for-loops)For-Loops

#### [](#an-arrays-length-should-be-cached-to-save-gas-in-for-loops)An array’s length should be cached to save gas in for-loops

Reading array length at each iteration of the loop takes 6 gas (3 for mload and 3 to place memory\_offset) in the stack.

Caching the array length in the stack saves around 3 gas per iteration.

Here, I suggest storing the array’s length in a variable before the for-loop, and use it instead:

    ClearingHouse.sol:122:        for (uint i = 0; i < amms.length; i++) {
    ClearingHouse.sol:130:        for (uint i = 0; i < amms.length; i++) {
    ClearingHouse.sol:170:        for (uint i = 0; i < amms.length; i++) {
    ClearingHouse.sol:194:        for (uint i = 0; i < amms.length; i++) { // liquidate all positions
    ClearingHouse.sol:251:        for (uint i = 0; i < amms.length; i++) {
    ClearingHouse.sol:263:        for (uint i = 0; i < amms.length; i++) {
    ClearingHouse.sol:277:        for (uint i = 0; i < amms.length; i++) {
    MarginAccount.sol:331:        for (uint i = 0; i < idxs.length; i++) {
    MarginAccount.sol:373:        for (uint i = 1 /* skip vusd */; i < assets.length; i++) {
    MarginAccount.sol:521:        for (uint i = 0; i < assets.length; i++) {
    MarginAccount.sol:552:        for (uint i = 0; i < _collaterals.length; i++) {

#### [](#i-costs-less-gas-compared-to-i)`++i` costs less gas compared to `i++`

`++i` costs less gas compared to `i++` for unsigned integer, as pre-increment is cheaper (about 5 gas per iteration)

`i++` increments `i` and returns the initial value of `i`. Which means:

    uint i = 1;  
    i++; // == 1 but i == 2  

But `++i` returns the actual incremented value:

    uint i = 1;  
    ++i; // == 2 and i == 2 too, so no need for a temporary variable  

In the first case, the compiler has to create a temporary variable (when used) for returning `1` instead of `2`

Instances include:

    ClearingHouse.sol:122:        for (uint i = 0; i < amms.length; i++) {
    ClearingHouse.sol:130:        for (uint i = 0; i < amms.length; i++) {
    ClearingHouse.sol:170:        for (uint i = 0; i < amms.length; i++) {
    ClearingHouse.sol:194:        for (uint i = 0; i < amms.length; i++) { // liquidate all positions
    ClearingHouse.sol:251:        for (uint i = 0; i < amms.length; i++) {
    ClearingHouse.sol:263:        for (uint i = 0; i < amms.length; i++) {
    ClearingHouse.sol:277:        for (uint i = 0; i < amms.length; i++) {
    MarginAccount.sol:331:        for (uint i = 0; i < idxs.length; i++) {
    MarginAccount.sol:373:        for (uint i = 1 /* skip vusd */; i < assets.length; i++) {
    MarginAccount.sol:521:        for (uint i = 0; i < assets.length; i++) {
    MarginAccount.sol:552:        for (uint i = 0; i < _collaterals.length; i++) {

I suggest using `++i` instead of `i++` to increment the value of an uint variable.

#### [](#increments-can-be-unchecked)Increments can be unchecked

In Solidity 0.8+, there’s a default overflow check on unsigned integers. It’s possible to uncheck this in for-loops and save some gas at each iteration, but at the cost of some code readability, as this uncheck cannot be made inline.

[ethereum/solidity#10695](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/10695)

Instances include:

    ClearingHouse.sol:122:        for (uint i = 0; i < amms.length; i++) {
    ClearingHouse.sol:130:        for (uint i = 0; i < amms.length; i++) {
    ClearingHouse.sol:170:        for (uint i = 0; i < amms.length; i++) {
    ClearingHouse.sol:194:        for (uint i = 0; i < amms.length; i++) { // liquidate all positions
    ClearingHouse.sol:251:        for (uint i = 0; i < amms.length; i++) {
    ClearingHouse.sol:263:        for (uint i = 0; i < amms.length; i++) {
    ClearingHouse.sol:277:        for (uint i = 0; i < amms.length; i++) {
    MarginAccount.sol:331:        for (uint i = 0; i < idxs.length; i++) {
    MarginAccount.sol:373:        for (uint i = 1 /* skip vusd */; i < assets.length; i++) {
    MarginAccount.sol:521:        for (uint i = 0; i < assets.length; i++) {
    MarginAccount.sol:552:        for (uint i = 0; i < _collaterals.length; i++) {

The code would go from:

    for (uint256 i; i < numIterations; i++) {  
     // ...  
    }  

to:

    for (uint256 i; i < numIterations;) {  
     // ...  
     unchecked { ++i; }  
    }  

The risk of overflow is inexistant for a `uint256` here.

### [](#arithmetics)Arithmetics

#### [](#shift-right-instead-of-dividing-by-2)Shift Right instead of Dividing by 2

A division by 2 can be calculated by shifting one to the right.

While the `DIV` opcode uses 5 gas, the `SHR` opcode only uses 3 gas. Furthermore, Solidity’s division operation also includes a division-by-0 prevention which is bypassed using shifting.

I suggest replacing `/ 2` with `>> 1` here:

    ClearingHouse.sol:212:            uint toInsurance = liquidationFee / 2;

### [](#errors)Errors

#### [](#reduce-the-size-of-error-messages-long-revert-strings)Reduce the size of error messages (Long revert Strings)

Shortening revert strings to fit in 32 bytes will decrease deployment time gas and will decrease runtime gas when the revert condition is met.

Revert strings that are longer than 32 bytes require at least one additional mstore, along with additional overhead for computing memory offset, etc.

Revert strings > 32 bytes are here:

    AMM.sol:487:        require(baseAssetQuantity > 0, "VAMM._long: baseAssetQuantity is <= 0");
    AMM.sol:511:        require(baseAssetQuantity < 0, "VAMM._short: baseAssetQuantity is >= 0");
    ClearingHouse.sol:84:            require(isAboveMinAllowableMargin(trader), "CH: Below Minimum Allowable Margin");
    ClearingHouse.sol:101:        require(isAboveMinAllowableMargin(maker), "CH: Below Minimum Allowable Margin");
    MarginAccount.sol:174:        require(margin[VUSD_IDX][trader] >= 0, "Cannot remove margin when vusd balance is negative");
    MarginAccount.sol:354:        require(notionalPosition == 0, "Liquidate positions before settling bad debt");
    MarginAccount.sol:453:        require(repay <= maxRepay, "Need to repay more to seize that much"); 

I suggest shortening the revert strings to fit in 32 bytes, or that using custom errors as described next.

#### [](#use-custom-errors-instead-of-revert-strings-to-save-gas)Use Custom Errors instead of Revert Strings to save Gas

Custom errors from Solidity 0.8.4 are cheaper than revert strings (cheaper deployment cost and runtime cost when the revert condition is met)

Source: [https://blog.soliditylang.org/2021/04/21/custom-errors/](https://blog.soliditylang.org/2021/04/21/custom-errors/):

> Starting from [Solidity v0.8.4](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/releases/tag/v0.8.4), there is a convenient and gas-efficient way to explain to users why an operation failed through the use of custom errors. Until now, you could already use strings to give more information about failures (e.g., `revert("Insufficient funds.");`), but they are rather expensive, especially when it comes to deploy cost, and it is difficult to use dynamic information in them.

Custom errors are defined using the `error` statement, which can be used inside and outside of contracts (including interfaces and libraries).

See [original submission](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-hubble-findings/issues/135) for instances.

I suggest replacing revert strings with custom errors.
