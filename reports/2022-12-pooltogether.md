[](#about-c4)About C4
---------------------

Code4rena (C4) is an open organization consisting of security researchers, auditors, developers, and individuals with domain expertise in smart contracts.

A C4 audit contest is an event in which community participants, referred to as Wardens, review, audit, or analyze smart contract logic in exchange for a bounty provided by sponsoring projects.

During the audit contest outlined in this document, C4 conducted an analysis of the PoolTogether smart contract system written in Solidity. The audit contest took place between December 1—December 5 2022.

This contest was judged by [Alex the Entreprenerd](https://twitter.com/GalloDaSballo).

Final report assembled by [liveactionllama](https://twitter.com/liveactionllama).

[](#summary)Summary
===================

The C4 analysis yielded an aggregated total of 3 unique vulnerabilities. Of these vulnerabilities, 0 received a risk rating in the category of HIGH severity and 3 received a risk rating in the category of MEDIUM severity.

Additionally, C4 analysis included 4 reports detailing issues with a risk rating of LOW severity or non-critical. There were also 8 reports recommending gas optimizations.

All of the issues presented here are linked back to their original finding.

[](#scope)Scope
===============

The code under review can be found within the [C4 PoolTogether contest repository](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-pooltogether), and is composed of 7 smart contracts written in the Solidity programming language and includes 279 lines of Solidity code.

[](#severity-criteria)Severity Criteria
=======================================

C4 assesses the severity of disclosed vulnerabilities according to a methodology based on [OWASP standards](https://owasp.org/www-community/OWASP_Risk_Rating_Methodology).

Vulnerabilities are divided into three primary risk categories: high, medium, and low/non-critical.

High-level considerations for vulnerabilities span the following key areas when conducting assessments:

*   Malicious Input Handling
*   Escalation of privileges
*   Arithmetic
*   Gas use

Further information regarding the severity criteria referenced throughout the submission review process, please refer to the documentation provided on [the C4 website](https://code4rena.com).

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

_Submitted by [ktg](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-pooltogether-findings/issues/60), also found by [0x52](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-pooltogether-findings/issues/94)_

[EthereumToArbitrumRelayer.sol#L118-#L127](https://github.com/pooltogether/ERC5164/blob/5647bd84f2a6d1a37f41394874d567e45a97bf48/src/ethereum-arbitrum/EthereumToArbitrumRelayer.sol#L118-#L127)  

When someone wants to make calls to Arbitrum from Ethereum, first they call `relayCalls` to fingerprint their data and then anyone else can call `processCalls` to process the calls. According to the doc in Inbox source code [https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/blob/1f32bec6b9b228bb2fab4bfa02867716f65d0c5c/contracts/src/bridge/Inbox.sol#L427](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/blob/1f32bec6b9b228bb2fab4bfa02867716f65d0c5c/contracts/src/bridge/Inbox.sol#L427), function `createRetryableTicket` has one parameter called `callValueRefundAddress` and this is the address that is granted the option to `cancel` a `Retryable`. In `EthereumToArbitrumRelayer.sol` it’s currently set as `msg.sender` (5th parameter) which is whoever make the call to function `processCall`:

    uint256 _ticketID = inbox.createRetryableTicket{ value: msg.value }(
          address(executor),
          0,
          _maxSubmissionCost,
          msg.sender,
          msg.sender,
          _gasLimit,
          _gasPriceBid,
          _data
        );

This implementation allows an attacker to remove the possibility of a user to cancel their calls, which is an important mechanism to be properly implemented. This scenario demonstrates how this could happen:

*   User A call `relayCalls` to fingerprint their calls
*   User B call `processCalls` to process user A’s calls.
*   User A now changes his mind and wants to cancel his calls but he’s unable to since `callValueRefundAddress` is set to user B’s address, now user B is the one who decides whether to cancel user A’s calls or not, which should be user A’s option.
*   Another common case is when users’s calls failed, anyone can try to `redeem` it, according to the doc [https://developer.arbitrum.io/arbos/l1-to-l2-messaging](https://developer.arbitrum.io/arbos/l1-to-l2-messaging). So if a someone calls `processCalls` to process others’s calls and it fails, the owner of the calls now cannot cancel their calls and anyone else can redeem (reexecute) them.

It should be noted here that `EthereumToArbitrumRelayer.sol` provides no other functionality to cancel users’s calls, but it seems to rely only on Arbitrum’s Retryable cancel mechanism to do so.

### [](#recommended-mitigation-steps)Recommended Mitigation Steps

Currently, anyone can process others’s calls by calling `processCalls` functions and I think this does not pose any security risk as long as the user who actually fingerprinted these calls can reserve their rights to cancel it if they want to. Therefore, I recommend changing `callValueRefundAddress` in `createRetryableTicket` to `_sender`, this combines with event `ProcessedCalls(_nonce, msg.sender, _ticketID)` emitted at the end of `processCalls` function will allow a user to be notified if their calls has been processed by anyone else and they can cancel it in L2 using `_ticketID`.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

_Submitted by [cccz](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-pooltogether-findings/issues/63), also found by [joestakey](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-pooltogether-findings/issues/223), [enckrish](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-pooltogether-findings/issues/197), and [Chom](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-pooltogether-findings/issues/42)_

When the user calls CrossChainRelayerArbitrum.processCalls, ETH is sent as the submission fee.

According to the documentation : [https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum/blob/master/docs/L1\_L2\_Messages.md#retryable-transaction-lifecycle](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum/blob/master/docs/L1_L2_Messages.md#retryable-transaction-lifecycle)

    Credit-Back Address: Address to which all excess gas is credited on L2; i.e., excess ETH for base submission cost (MaxSubmissionCost - ActualSubmissionCostPaid) and excess ETH provided for L2 execution ( (GasPrice x MaxGas) - ActualETHSpentInExecution).
    ...
    Submission fee is collected: submission fee is deducted from the sender’s L2 account; MaxSubmissionCost - submission fee is credited to Credit-Back Address.

The excess submission fee is refunded to the address on L2 of the `excessFeeRefundAddress` provided when calling `createRetryableTicket`.

         * @notice Put a message in the L2 inbox that can be reexecuted for some fixed amount of time if it reverts
         * @dev all msg.value will deposited to callValueRefundAddress on L2
         * @param destAddr destination L2 contract address
         * @param l2CallValue call value for retryable L2 message
         * @param  maxSubmissionCost Max gas deducted from user's L2 balance to cover base submission fee
         * @param excessFeeRefundAddress maxgas x gasprice - execution cost gets credited here on L2 balance
         * @param callValueRefundAddress l2Callvalue gets credited here on L2 if retryable txn times out or gets cancelled
         * @param maxGas Max gas deducted from user's L2 balance to cover L2 execution
         * @param gasPriceBid price bid for L2 execution
         * @param data ABI encoded data of L2 message
         * @return unique id for retryable transaction (keccak256(requestID, uint(0) )
         */
        function createRetryableTicket(
            address destAddr,
            uint256 l2CallValue,
            uint256 maxSubmissionCost,
            address excessFeeRefundAddress,
            address callValueRefundAddress,
            uint256 maxGas,
            uint256 gasPriceBid,
            bytes calldata data
        ) external payable virtual override onlyWhitelisted returns (uint256) {

In `CrossChainRelayerArbitrum.processCalls`, `excessFeeRefundAddress == msg.sender`.

        uint256 _ticketID = inbox.createRetryableTicket{ value: msg.value }(
          address(executor),
          0,
          _maxSubmissionCost,
          msg.sender,   // @audit : excessFeeRefundAddress
          msg.sender,  // @audit: callValueRefundAddress
          _gasLimit,
          _gasPriceBid,
          _data
        );

For EOA accounts, the excess submission fees are correctly refunded to their address on L2. However, for smart contracts, since there may not exist a corresponding address on L2, these excess submission fees will be lost.

Also, since the `callValueRefundAddress` is also `msg.sender`, according to the documentation, if the Retryable Ticket is cancelled or expired, then the smart contract caller may lose all the submission fees

    If the Retryable Ticket is cancelled or expires before it is redeemed, Callvalue is credited to Beneficiary.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

_Submitted by [AkshaySrivastav](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-pooltogether-findings/issues/166), also found by [ladboy233](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-pooltogether-findings/issues/160), [hihen](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-pooltogether-findings/issues/49), and [csanuragjain](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-pooltogether-findings/issues/18)_

[EthereumToOptimismExecutor.sol#L45-L59](https://github.com/pooltogether/ERC5164/blob/5647bd84f2a6d1a37f41394874d567e45a97bf48/src/ethereum-optimism/EthereumToOptimismExecutor.sol#L45-L59)

The `CrossChainExecutorArbitrum` and `CrossChainExecutorOptimism` contracts both use `CallLib` library to invoke `Call`s on external contract. As per the `CallLib` library implementation, any failing `Call` results in the entire transaction getting reverted.

The `CrossChainExecutor` contracts does not store whether the calls in `CallLib.Call[]` were already attempted which failed.

This creates several issues for `CrossChainExecutor` contracts.

1.  Offchain components can be tricked to submit failing `Call[]`s again and again. This can be used to drain the offchain component of gas.
2.  Once a failing `Call[]` was invoked (which failed) and if again the same `Call[]` is invoked, the transaction should revert with `CallsAlreadyExecuted` error but it reverts with `CallFailure` error.
3.  It is difficult to determine whether a to-be executed `Call[]` is pending or the invocation was already tried but failed.

PoCs for the above issues are listed below.

### [](#proof-of-concept-1)Proof of Concept

#### [](#scenario-1)Scenario 1

    contract Foo {
        function bar() public {
            for(uint256 i; ; i++) {}
        }
    }

*   The attacker relays the `Foo.bar()` call in the `CrossChainRelayer` contract with `maxGasLimit` as the `_gasLimit` parameter.
*   The transport layer tries to invoke the `Foo.bar()` call by calling the `CrossChainExecutor.executeCalls()`. This transaction reverts costing the transport layer client `maxGasLimit` gas.
*   Since no state updates were performed in `CrossChainExecutor`, the transport layer still assumes the relayed call as pending which needs to be executed. The transport layer client again tries to execute the pending relayed call which reverts again.
*   Repeated execution of the above steps can deplete the gas reserves of transport layer client.

#### [](#scenario-2)Scenario 2

    contract Foo {
        function bar() public {
            revert();
        }
    }

*   The attacker relays the `Foo.bar()` call in the `CrossChainRelayer` contract.
*   The transport layer tries to invoke the `Foo.bar()` call by calling the `CrossChainExecutor.executeCalls()`. This transaction gets reverted.
*   Since the relayed calls still seems as pending, the transport layer tries to invoke the `Foo.bar()` call again. This call should get reverted with `CallsAlreadyExecuted` error but it gets reverted with `CallFailure` error.

### [](#recommended-mitigation-steps-2)Recommended Mitigation Steps

The `CrossChainExecutor` contract should store whether a relayed call was attempted to be executed to make sure the execution cannot be tried again.

The `CallLib` library can be changed to not completely revert the transaction when any individual `Call` gets failed.

[](#l-01-hard-coding-the-maxgaslimit-variable-may-cause-problems-in-the-future)\[L-01\] Hard-coding the `maxGasLimit` variable may cause problems in the future
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The variable `maxGasLimit` is defined as immutable and its value is assigned in `constructor` but cannot be changed later

EVM-Based blockchains are hardforked and there is no such thing as Gas Limit etc. values may change, this has happened in the past, so it is recommended to have this value updated in the future

**Description:**  
Solidity code is also cleaner in another way that might not be noticeable: the struct Point. We were importing it previously with global import but not using it. The Point struct `polluted the source code` with an unnecessary object we were not using because we did not need it.  
This was breaking the rule of modularity and modular programming: `only import what you need` Specific imports with curly braces allow us to apply this rule better.

**Recommendation:**  
`import {contract1 , contract2} from "filename.sol";`

A good example from the ArtGobblers project;

    import {Owned} from "solmate/auth/Owned.sol";
    import {ERC721} from "solmate/tokens/ERC721.sol";
    import {LibString} from "solmate/utils/LibString.sol";

    import {FixedPointMathLib} from "solmate/utils/FixedPointMathLib.sol";

      65:         abi.encodePacked(_call.data, _nonce, _sender)
      66:       );

Rather than using `abi.encodePacked` for appending bytes, since version 0.8.4, `bytes.concat()` is enabled

Since version 0.8.4 for appending bytes, `bytes.concat()` can be used instead of `abi.encodePacked(,)`.

[](#gas-optimizations)Gas Optimizations
=======================================

For this contest, 8 reports were submitted by wardens detailing gas optimizations. The [report highlighted below](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-pooltogether-findings/issues/179) by **Tricko** received the top score from the judge.

_The following wardens also submitted reports: [adriro](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-pooltogether-findings/issues/214), [cryptonue](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-pooltogether-findings/issues/210), [Madalad](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-pooltogether-findings/issues/195), [AkshaySrivastav](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-pooltogether-findings/issues/177), [Rolezn](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-pooltogether-findings/issues/102), [neko\_nyaa](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-pooltogether-findings/issues/32), and [0x4non](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-pooltogether-findings/issues/22)._

[](#g-01-use-bitmaps-to-save-gas)\[G-01\] Use bitmaps to save gas
-----------------------------------------------------------------

During calls to `executeCalls` (and `processMessageFromRoot` in the Polygon executor) the `executed` mapping is updated, setting the bool flag to true, but because the way the EVM works it allocates an entire storage slot (256 bits) every time a new flag is set. `SSTORE` opcode cost up to 20000 gas for uninitialized slots like these. Consider using bitmaps instead, this enables you to convert the `mapping(uint256 => bool)` to a `mapping(uint256 => uint256)` and pay the cost of slot initialization just once every 256 `nonces` added, so the high gas costs are amortized over many calls.

Each group of 256 sequential `nonces` values (0-255, 256-511, …) are stored together in a single uint256, where each bit represents a bool. The correct index of each nonce inside each bitmap can be calculated by `nonce mod 256`. An exemplified implementation is shown below (For complete implementations see Modifications section)

    mapping(uint256 => uint256) public executed;
    
    //setting executed nonce value to true
    uint256 baseIndex = _nonce / 256;
    uint256 index = _nonce - (256 * baseIndex); 
    uint256 mask = 1 << index;
    executed[baseIndex] |= mask;
    
    //getting the executed bool flag for a specific nonce
    uint256 baseIndex = _nonce / 256;
    uint256 index = _nonce - (256 * baseIndex); 
    uint256 mask = 1 << index;
    bool _executedNonce = (executed[baseIndex] & mask) != 0

The full extent of the gas reduction from these changes cannot be seen using the tests present in the repo, as during the tests `executeCalls` are called at most a few times, so the effect of amortization cannot be seen, underestimating the effect of these changes. Extra tests were added to enable benchmarking more realistic conditions (See modifications section below), where `executeCalls` is called 100 times in sequence, simulating many user interacting with the contract during normal operating conditions. Using those benchmarks, we obtain the following results.

> Very interesting optimization but it does complexify the code quite a bit.  
> So for this reason, I’ve acknowledged the issue but we won’t implement the suggestion.

> I believe that in the spirit of Gas Reports, the report has shown:

> *   It’s fully benchmarked

> Am accepting the finding as valid, and because it effectively saves one SSTORE on each operation, I believe 20k gas to be the appropriate amount saved
